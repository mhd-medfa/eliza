0,Eliza,How do you do.  Please tell me your problem.
1,Sheldon," So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved it will, however, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
2,Eliza,Do you think its likely that it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target ?
3,Leonard," Agreed, what's your point?"
4,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my point? ?
5,Sheldon," There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt."
6,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
7,Leonard, Excuse me?
8,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
9,Receptionist, Hang on.
10,Eliza,Please go on.
11,Leonard," One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is... move your finger... phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti."
12,Eliza,What about your own finger ?
13,Receptionist, Can I help you?
14,Eliza,Whether or not you can help you? depends on you more than me.
15,Leonard," Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
16,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
17,Receptionist," If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here."
18,Eliza,Do you wish that I have to ask ?
19,Sheldon, I think this is the place.
20,Eliza,You say you think this is the place ?
21,Receptionist, Fill these out.
22,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
23,Leonard, Thank-you. We'll be right back.
24,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
25,Receptionist," Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait."
26,Eliza,Your crossword puzzle ?
27,Sheldon," Leonard, I don't think I can do this."
28,Eliza,Don't you really think you can do this ?
29,Leonard," What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro."
30,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
31,Sheldon," No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
32,Eliza,In what way ?
33,Leonard," Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
34,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's idea ?
35,Sheldon," I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
36,Eliza,What do you know about he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve ?
37,Leonard, I'm sure she'll still love him.
38,Eliza,Is it because you are sure she'll still love him that you came to me ?
39,Sheldon, I wouldn't.
40,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
41,Leonard," Well, what do you want to do?"
42,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
43,Sheldon, I want to leave.
44,Eliza,What would it mean to you if you got to leave ?
45,Leonard, Okay.
46,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your crossword puzzle .
47,Sheldon, What's the protocol for leaving?
48,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
49,Leonard," I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
50,Eliza,Why don't you know ?
51,Sheldon, Let's try just walking out.
52,Eliza,Please go on.
53,Leonard, Okay.
54,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
55,Receptionist, Bye.
56,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
57,Sheldon, Bye-bye
58,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
59,Leonard, See you.
60,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
61,Sheldon, Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
62,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am still mad about the sperm bank? or not ?
63,Leonard, No.
64,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
65,Sheldon, You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
66,Eliza,"Oh, I want to hear an interesting thing about stairs? ?"
67,Leonard, Not really.
68,Eliza,Please go on.
69,Sheldon," If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
70,Eliza,"Really, if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres ?"
71,Leonard, I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.
72,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to care ?
73,Sheldon," No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
74,Eliza,Were you really ?
75,Leonard, Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
76,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
77,Sheldon," No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
78,Eliza,Why do you say your work with lasers ?
79,Leonard, New neighbour?
80,Eliza,Earlier you said your work with lasers .
81,Sheldon, Evidently.
82,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
83,Leonard, Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
84,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
85,Sheldon," Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
86,Eliza,You are sure.
87,Penny," Oh, hi!"
88,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
89,Leonard, Hi.
90,Eliza,Please go on.
91,Sheldon, Hi.
92,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
93,Leonard, Hi.
94,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
95,Sheldon, Hi.
96,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
97,Penny, Hi?
98,Eliza,Please go on.
99,Leonard," We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
100,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
101,Penny," Oh, that's nice."
102,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
103,Leonard," Oh... uh... no... we don't live together... um... we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
104,Eliza,Why not ?
105,Penny," Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbour, Penny."
106,Eliza,How long have you been my new neighbour ?
107,Leonard," Leonard, Sheldon."
108,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
109,Penny, Hi.
110,Eliza,Please go on.
111,Leonard, Hi.
112,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
113,Sheldon, Hi.
114,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
115,Penny, Hi.
116,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
117,Leonard," Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
118,Eliza,Please go on.
119,Penny," Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime."
120,Eliza,You don't seem quite certain.
121,Leonard," Oh, great."
122,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
123,Penny, Great.
124,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
125,Sheldon, Great.
126,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
127,Leonard," Great. Well, bye."
128,Eliza,Please go on.
129,Penny, Bye.
130,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
131,Sheldon, Bye.
132,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
133,Leonard, Bye.
134,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
135,Leonard, Should we have invited her for lunch?
136,Eliza,Please go on.
137,Sheldon, No. We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
138,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
139,Leonard, We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
140,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
141,Sheldon, Not with commentary.
142,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
143,Leonard," I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
144,Eliza,Do you say you think we should be good neighbours for some special reason ?
145,Sheldon, We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
146,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
147,Leonard," Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
148,Eliza,Please go on.
149,Sheldon, I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
150,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
151,Leonard," Yes, and you've never met one of them."
152,Eliza,I see.
153,Sheldon, That's the beauty of it.
154,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
155,Leonard, I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.
156,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be going to invite her over ?
157,Sheldon, Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
158,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
159,Leonard," Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
160,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
161,Sheldon, To what end?
162,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
163,Leonard, Hi. Again.
164,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
165,Penny, Hi.
166,Eliza,Please go on.
167,Sheldon, Hi.
168,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
169,Leonard, Hi.
170,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
171,Penny, Hi.
172,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
173,Leonard," Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
174,Eliza,Do you enjoy being undergoing stress ?
175,Sheldon," Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
176,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
177,Penny," Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?"
178,Eliza,What makes you think I am inviting you over to eat? ?
179,Leonard," Uh, yes."
180,Eliza,I understand.
181,Penny," Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to."
182,Eliza,Please go on.
183,Leonard, Great.
184,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
185,Penny," So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"
186,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
187,Sheldon," Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
188,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
189,Leonard," Okay, well, make yourself at home."
190,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
191,Penny," Okay, thankyou."
192,Eliza,Please go on.
193,Leonard, You're very welcome.
194,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am very welcome ?
195,Penny," This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?"
196,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
197,Sheldon, Actually that's my work.
198,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
199,Penny, Wow.
200,Eliza,But your work .
201,Sheldon," Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
202,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
203,Penny," So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
204,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
205,Sheldon, Yeah.
206,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
207,Penny, This is really impressive.
208,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
209,Leonard," I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
210,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I like boards ?
211,Penny, Holy smokes.
212,Eliza,Please go on.
213,Sheldon," If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure."
214,Eliza,Do you wish that by holy smokes I mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff I can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT ?
215,Leonard, What?
216,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
217,Sheldon," Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”"
218,Eliza,You say Oh ?
219,Leonard, At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
220,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
221,Sheldon," I didn't invent them, they're there."
222,Eliza,Do you say you didn't invent them for some special reason ?
223,Leonard, In what universe?
224,Eliza,What do you think ?
225,Sheldon," In all of them, that is the point."
226,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
227,Penny," Uh, do you guys mind if I start?"
228,Eliza,What do you know about you start? ?
229,Sheldon," Um, Penny, that's where I sit."
230,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
231,Penny," So, sit next to me."
232,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
233,Sheldon," No, I sit there."
234,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
235,Penny, What's the difference?
236,Eliza,Please go on.
237,Sheldon, What's the difference?
238,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
239,Leonard, Here we go.
240,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
241,Sheldon," In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point."
242,Eliza,Is it important that your point ?
243,Penny, Do you want me to move?
244,Eliza,Why do you think I want you ?
245,Sheldon, Well.
246,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your point ?
247,Leonard, Just sit somewhere else.
248,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
249,Sheldon, Fine.
250,Eliza,Please go on.
251,Leonard," Sheldon, sit!"
252,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
253,Sheldon, Aaah!
254,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
255,Leonard, Well this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.
256,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
257,Sheldon, That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
258,Eliza,Please go on.
259,Leonard," Yes I now, but..."
260,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
261,Sheldon, Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
262,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
263,Leonard," Yes, I remember."
264,Eliza,Do you often think of ?
265,Sheldon, I resent you saying we don't have company.
266,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we resent each other.
267,Leonard, I'm sorry.
268,Eliza,Is it because you are sorry that you came to me ?
269,Sheldon, That is an antisocial implication.
270,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
271,Leonard, I said I'm sorry.
272,Eliza,How long have you been sorry ?
273,Penny," So, Klingon boggle?"
274,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
275,Leonard," Yeah, it's like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you."
276,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
277,Penny," Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
278,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be Sagittarius ?
279,Sheldon," Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
280,Eliza,You are sure.
281,Penny, Participate in the what?
282,Eliza,Please go on.
283,Leonard," I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess."
284,Eliza,You say you think what Sheldon's trying to say ?
285,Penny," Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak."
286,Eliza,Do you enjoy being a vegetarian ?
287,Sheldon, That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
288,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
289,Leonard," Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
290,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
291,Penny," Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
292,Eliza,Is it because you are a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory that you came to me ?
293,Leonard," Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
294,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
295,Sheldon, You're lactose intolerant.
296,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were lactose intolerant ?
297,Leonard," I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea."
298,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
299,Penny," Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
300,Eliza,How long have you been also writing a screenplay ?
301,Leonard, So it's based on your life?
302,Eliza,"Really, my life? ?"
303,Penny," No, I'm from Omaha."
304,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
305,Leonard," Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
306,Eliza,"Really, if that was a movie you would go see it ?"
307,Penny," I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny."
308,Eliza,Do you say you know for some special reason ?
309,Leonard, Well it sounds wonderful.
310,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
311,Penny, It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
312,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
313,Sheldon, What's happening.
314,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
315,Leonard, I don't know.
316,Eliza,Don't you really know ?
317,Penny," Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School."
318,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
319,Sheldon, It took you four years to get through High School?
320,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
321,Leonard, Don't.
322,Eliza,Please go on.
323,Penny," I just, I can't believe I trusted him."
324,Eliza,How do you think that you can't believe you trusted him ?
325,Leonard, Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
326,Eliza,Do you really think so ?
327,Sheldon," You? No, you'll only make it worse."
328,Eliza,Why not ?
329,Penny," You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?"
330,Eliza,"Oh, I want to know the most pathetic part? Even though you hate his lying ?"
331,Sheldon, Yes.
332,Eliza,I see.
333,Leonard," No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse."
334,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
335,Penny," Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work."
336,Eliza,Your stupid shower doesn't even work ?
337,Leonard, Our shower works.
338,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your stupid shower doesn't even work .
339,Penny, Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
340,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you used it? ?
341,Sheldon, Yes.
342,Eliza,I understand.
343,Leonard, No.
344,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
345,Sheldon, No?
346,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
347,Leonard, No.
348,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
349,Sheldon, No.
350,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
351,Leonard, It's right down the hall.
352,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
353,Penny, Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
354,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
355,Sheldon, Well this is an interesting development.
356,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
357,Leonard, How so?
358,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
359,Sheldon, It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
360,Eliza,Please go on.
361,Leonard," That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode."
362,Eliza,Why do you say your grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode ?
363,Sheldon, Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.
364,Eliza,Earlier you said your grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode .
365,Leonard, The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
366,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
367,Sheldon," So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
368,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
369,Leonard, Excuse me?
370,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
371,Sheldon, That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.
372,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
373,Leonard, Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.
374,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be not trying to have sex with her ?
375,Sheldon," Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed."
376,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
377,Leonard," What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?"
378,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
379,Sheldon," Yes, but not of the same species."
380,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
381,Leonard," I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour."
382,Eliza,Do you enjoy being just trying to be a good neighbour ?
383,Sheldon," Oh, of course."
384,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
385,Leonard, That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
386,Eliza,Do you wish that a carnal relationship was to develop that you wouldn't participate ?
387,Sheldon, Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
388,Eliza,"Oh, I think this possibility will be helped or hindered what she discovers my Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? ?"
389,Leonard, It's Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
390,Eliza,Please go on.
391,Howard, Wait till you see this.
392,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
393,Raj, It's fantastic. Unbelievable.
394,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
395,Leonard, See what?
396,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
397,Howard, It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
398,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
399,Leonard, This is not a good time.
400,Eliza,Please go on.
401,Leonard," That's great, you guys have to go."
402,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
403,Raj, Why?
404,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
405,Leonard, It's just not a good time.
406,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
407,Sheldon, Leonard has a lady over.
408,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
409,Howard," Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
410,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my grandmother back in town? ?
411,Leonard," No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbour."
412,Eliza,Why not ?
413,Howard," Hang on, there really is a lady here?"
414,Eliza,Please go on.
415,Leonard, Uh-huh.
416,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
417,Howard, And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?
418,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be anticipating coitus? .
419,Leonard, I'm not anticipating coitus.
420,Eliza,Is it because you are not anticipating coitus that you came to me ?
421,Howard, So she's available for coitus?
422,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
423,Leonard, Can we please stop saying coitus?
424,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
425,Sheldon, Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
426,Eliza,Please go on.
427,Penny," Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!"
428,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
429,Howard," Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
430,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
431,Penny, Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
432,Eliza,You say Penny ?
433,Leonard," Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower."
434,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
435,Howard, Bon douche.
436,Eliza,But your work .
437,Penny, I'm sorry?
438,Eliza,How long have you been sorry? ?
439,Howard, It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
440,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
441,Leonard," Save it for your blog, Howard."
442,Eliza,What about your own blog ?
443,Howard, See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
444,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
445,Leonard," Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry."
446,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
447,Penny, Okay. Thanks.
448,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
449,Leonard," You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll...."
450,Eliza,What makes you think I am going to step right ?
451,Penny," Hey, Leonard?"
452,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
453,Leonard, The hair products are Sheldon's.
454,Eliza,Did you think they might not be Sheldon's ?
455,Penny," Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour."
456,Eliza,Do you want to be able to ask I a favour ?
457,Leonard," A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you."
458,Eliza,You like to think I can ask you -- don't you ?
459,Penny, It's okay if you say no.
460,Eliza,What do you know about I say no ?
461,Leonard," Oh, I'll probably say yes."
462,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
463,Penny, It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.
464,Eliza,"Oh, I ask a guy you've just met ?"
465,Leonard, Wow.
466,Eliza,Please go on.
467,Sheldon, I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
468,Eliza,Do you say you really think we should examine the chain of causality here for some special reason ?
469,Leonard, Must we?
470,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
471,Sheldon," Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
472,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
473,Leonard," She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon."
474,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
475,Sheldon," Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
476,Eliza,You are sure.
477,Leonard, Which is?
478,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
479,Sheldon, You think with your penis.
480,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
481,Leonard, That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
482,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
483,Sheldon," Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV."
484,Eliza,I see.
485,Leonard," Come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
486,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
487,Sheldon, No I don't. And neither do you.
488,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
489,Leonard," Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim."
490,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
491,Sheldon," You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
492,Eliza,"Oh, I did not break up with Joyce Kim ?"
493,Leonard, To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
494,Eliza,Please go on.
495,Sheldon, So we get to have a scene with him?
496,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
497,Leonard," No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him."
498,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
499,Sheldon," Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV."
500,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
501,Penny," So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?"
502,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
503,Penny," Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?"
504,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sorry ?
505,Howard," Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women."
506,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
507,Penny," Really, why?"
508,Eliza,Please go on.
509,Howard, He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?
510,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
511,Leonard, I'll do the talking.
512,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
513,Voice from buzzer, Yeah.
514,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
515,Leonard," Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon."
516,Eliza,Is it because you are Leonard that you came to me ?
517,Sheldon, Hello.
518,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
519,Leonard," What did I just.... Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV."
520,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
521,Voice, Get lost.
522,Eliza,Please go on.
523,Sheldon," Okay, thanks for your time."
524,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's time ?
525,Leonard, We're not going to give up just like that.
526,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
527,Sheldon," Leonard, the TV is in the building, we've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
528,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not done ?
529,Leonard," Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
530,Eliza,"Really, if you was to give up at the first little hitch you never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang ?"
531,Sheldon, My apologies. What's your plan.
532,Eliza,Is it important that your apologies ?
533,Sheldon, It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
534,Eliza,"Really, my mind at work ?"
535,Leonard," Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
536,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
537,Sheldon, What do you think their combined IQ is?
538,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
539,Leonard, Just grab the door.
540,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your apologies ?
541,Leonard, This is it.  I'll do the talking.
542,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
543,Sheldon," Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle."
544,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
545,Enormous man, Yeah?
546,Eliza,Please go on.
547,Leonard," I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon."
548,Eliza,How long have you been Leonard ?
549,Sheldon, From the intercom.
550,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
551,Man, How the hell did you get in the building?
552,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
553,Leonard, Oh. We're scientists.
554,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
555,Sheldon, Tell him about our IQ.
556,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
557,Sheldon, Leonard.
558,Eliza,Please go on.
559,Leonard, What?
560,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
561,Sheldon, My mom bought me those pants.
562,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
563,Leonard, I'm sorry.
564,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
565,Sheldon, You're going to have to call her.
566,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am going to have to call her ?
567,Leonard," Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this."
568,Eliza,Do you enjoy being so sorry you dragged I through this ?
569,Sheldon," It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last."
570,Eliza,Your last ?
571,Leonard," And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex."
572,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex now ?
573,Sheldon, Well you got me out of my pants.
574,Eliza,Why do you say your pants ?
575,Leonard," Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone."
576,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
577,Sheldon," Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone."
578,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were not going to die alone ?
579,Leonard," Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend."
580,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be a good friend .
581,Sheldon, And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
582,Eliza,What makes you think I am yes not going to win a Nobel Prize ?
583,Howard," This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
584,Eliza,Is it important that your favourite places to kick back after a quest ?
585,Penny," Wow, cool tiger."
586,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your work ?
587,Howard," Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
588,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
589,Penny," Uh, sounds interesting."
590,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your favourite places to kick back after a quest .
591,Howard, So you'll think about it?
592,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your mom bought you those pants .
593,Penny," Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it."
594,Eliza,Why don't you think I'll be able to stop thinking about it ?
595,Raj, Smooth.
596,Eliza,Earlier you said your last .
597,Leonard, We're home.
598,Eliza,But your pants .
599,Penny," Oh, my God, what happened?"
600,Eliza,Your God ?
601,Leonard," Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
602,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my ex-boyfriend sends his regards and you think the rest is fairly self-explanatory ?
603,Penny," I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass."
604,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I guys went instead of you he wouldn't be such an ass ?
605,Leonard," No, it was a valid hypothesis."
606,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
607,Sheldon, That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
608,Eliza,What do you think ?
609,Penny," Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
610,Eliza,Why do you say your purse and dinner is on you ?
611,Leonard, Really? Great.
612,Eliza,But your purse and dinner is on you .
613,Sheldon," Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?"
614,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am not done with her ?
615,Leonard, Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
616,Eliza,Earlier you said your God .
617,Sheldon, Not to mention imaginary.
618,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
619,Leonard, Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
620,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
621,Penny, Sure.
622,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
623,Sheldon," We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
624,Eliza,Please go on.
625,Penny, So?
626,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
627,Sheldon, They're both curry based cuisines.
628,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
629,Penny, So?
630,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
631,Sheldon, They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
632,Eliza,You say They would be gastronomically redundant ?
633,Penny, Any ideas Raj?
634,Eliza,Please go on.
635,Howard, Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
636,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
637,Penny, That sounds like fun.
638,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
639,Howard," Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me."
640,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
641,Sheldon," I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy."
642,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know what my odds are in the world as a whole ?
643,Leonard," There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts."
644,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
645,Howard, But does it have peanut oil?
646,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
647,Leonard," Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."
648,Eliza,"Realy, everyone ?"
649,Sheldon," Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
650,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
651,Raj, Are there any chopsticks?
652,Eliza,What if they were not there any chopsticks? ?
653,Sheldon," You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
654,Eliza,"Oh, I don't need chopsticks ?"
655,Leonard, Here we go.
656,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your epinephrine ?
657,Sheldon," Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
658,Eliza,Please go on.
659,Leonard," Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I'll get it."
660,Eliza,Do you wish to dare me ?
661,Howard, Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
662,Eliza,Do you say Do you look puffy? you feel puffy for some special reason ?
663,Penny, Hey Leonard.
664,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
665,Leonard," Oh, hi Penny."
666,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
667,Penny, Am I interrupting.
668,Eliza,Do you believe you are interrupting ?
669,Leonard, No.
670,Eliza,Why not ?
671,Sheldon," You're not swelling, Howard."
672,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were not swelling ?
673,Howard," No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages."
674,Eliza,Is it important that your fingers ?
675,Penny, Sounds like you have company.
676,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
677,Leonard," They're not going anywhere.  So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work."
678,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be coming home from work .
679,Penny," Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them."
680,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
681,Leonard," So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
682,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
683,Penny," Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was...."
684,Eliza,Do you wish that I could help you out with something ?
685,Leonard, Yes.
686,Eliza,I understand.
687,Penny," Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so....  Oh! Hel...hello!"
688,Eliza,Is it because you are having some furniture delivered tomorrow that you came to me ?
689,Howard, .
690,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your fingers .
691,Penny, I'm sorry?
692,Eliza,How long have you been sorry? ?
693,Howard, Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
694,Eliza,What makes you think I am in flawless Russian? ?
695,Penny," No, I haven't."
696,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
697,Howard, Get used to it.
698,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
699,Penny," Yeah, I probably won't, but... Hey Sheldon."
700,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
701,Sheldon, Hi.
702,Eliza,Please go on.
703,Penny," Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?"
704,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
705,Sheldon," Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women."
706,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
707,Howard," He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake-scented Goddess!"
708,Eliza,What about your own case a cheesecake-scented Goddess! ?
709,Leonard," So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?"
710,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
711,Penny," Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
712,Eliza,What do you know about it gets here and you are not here tomorrow could I just sign for it and have them put it in your apartment ?
713,Leonard," Yeah, no problem."
714,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
715,Penny," Great, here's my spare key. Thank you."
716,Eliza,Your spare key ?
717,Leonard," Penny, wait."
718,Eliza,Earlier you said your spare key .
719,Penny, Yeah?
720,Eliza,Please go on.
721,Leonard," Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
722,Eliza,"Really, if I don't have any other plans ?"
723,Penny," A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?"
724,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
725,Sheldon," You're kidding, right?"
726,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am kidding ?
727,Penny," Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?"
728,Eliza,You say Yeah ?
729,"Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together", One. .
730,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
731,Sheldon, You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
732,Eliza,"Oh, I realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy ?"
733,Penny," Yes, I know, men can't fly."
734,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
735,Sheldon," Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."
736,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
737,Leonard," Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates."
738,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
739,Sheldon," In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
740,Eliza,Do you think its likely that he really loved her ?
741,Leonard," Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength."
742,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength ?
743,Sheldon," Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun."
744,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't listening to myself ?
745,Howard," Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
746,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
747,Sheldon," Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells."
748,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
749,Penny, I'm just going to go wash up.
750,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be just going to go wash up ?
751,Leonard," I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells."
752,Eliza,You seem to need to challenge me.
753,Sheldon, Challenge accepted.  We're locked out.
754,Eliza,Please go on.
755,Raj," Also, the pretty girl left."
756,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
757,Leonard," Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to  oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves."
758,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were just going to be done ?
759,Sheldon, I hardly think so.
760,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
761,Leonard, Why not?
762,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
763,Sheldon," Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
764,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
765,Leonard," We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter...  I don't have this... I don't have this I don't have this."
766,Eliza,Possibly they are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes .
767,Sheldon, Archimedes would be so proud.
768,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
769,Leonard, Do you have any ideas?
770,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
771,Sheldon," Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
772,Eliza,You are sure.
773,Leonard," Easy, easy  Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half."
774,Eliza,Please go on.
775,Sheldon, Exactly half.
776,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
777,Leonard," Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math."
778,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
779,Sheldon, What's your formula for the corner.
780,Eliza,"Really, my formula for the corner ?"
781,Leonard," What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
782,Eliza,Why not ?
783,Sheldon," Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
784,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
785,Sheldon, You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
786,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
787,Leonard, Men do things for women without expecting sex.
788,Eliza,Please go on.
789,Sheldon," Yeah, those are men who just had sex."
790,Eliza,Did you think they might not be men who just had sex ?
791,Leonard," I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds."
792,Eliza,Do you enjoy being doing this to be a good neighbour ?
793,Leonard," Almost there, almost there, almost there."
794,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
795,Sheldon," No we're not, no we're not, no we're not."
796,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
797,Sheldon," Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!"
798,Eliza,Why do you say your fingers! ?
799,Leonard, You okay?
800,Eliza,"Oh, I okay? ?"
801,Sheldon," No, it hurt...  Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?"
802,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
803,Leonard, So Penny's a little messy.
804,Eliza,But your fingers! .
805,Sheldon," A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale."
806,Eliza,Is it because you are just inferring that this is a couch that you came to me ?
807,Leonard," Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
808,Eliza,Surely not everyone .
809,Sheldon, No.
810,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
811,Leonard," Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
812,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
813,Sheldon," Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times."
814,Eliza,Do you say Excuse you for some special reason ?
815,Leonard," Come on, we should go."
816,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
817,Sheldon, Hang on.
818,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
819,Leonard, What are you doing?
820,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
821,Sheldon, Straightening up.
822,Eliza,Please go on.
823,Leonard," Sheldon, this is not your home."
824,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my home ?
825,Sheldon," This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
826,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
827,Leonard," When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place."
828,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
829,Sheldon," Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
830,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
831,Leonard, What were you doing in his closet?
832,Eliza,Would you like to believe I was doing in his closet? ?
833,Sheldon, I helped run some cable for a webcam.
834,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
835,Penny, Hey guys.
836,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
837,Leonard," Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
838,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
839,Penny, Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
840,Eliza,Please go on.
841,Leonard, No.
842,Eliza,Why not ?
843,Sheldon, No?
844,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
845,Leonard, No.
846,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
847,Sheldon, No.
848,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
849,Leonard," Well, we'll get out of your hair."
850,Eliza,What about your own hair ?
851,Penny," Oh, great, thank you again ."
852,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
853,Sheldon," Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you."
854,Eliza,How long have you been here for I ?
855,Penny, What's he talking about?
856,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
857,Leonard, It's a joke.
858,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
859,Penny, I don't get it.
860,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
861,Leonard," Yeah, he didn't tell it right."
862,Eliza,Please go on.
863,Leonard, Sheldon?
864,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
865,Leonard, Sheldon? Hello?
866,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
867,Leonard, Sheldon!
868,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
869,Sheldon, Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.
870,Eliza,Please go on.
871,Leonard," Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
872,Eliza,Perhaps I am insane in your fantasies.
873,Sheldon," I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was... this."
874,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
875,Leonard," Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?"
876,Eliza,Do you wish that Penny wakes up ?
877,Sheldon, I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
878,Eliza,Do you just gave anyone else ?
879,Leonard," No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
880,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
881,Sheldon, Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.
882,Eliza,You say Don't be ridiculous ?
883,Leonard," Sheldon, we have to get out of here."
884,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your bedroom was our living room ?
885,Sheldon, You might want to speak in a lower register.
886,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
887,Leonard, What?
888,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
889,Sheldon," Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
890,Eliza,What do you know about I want to avoid waking her ?
891,Leonard, That's ridiculous.
892,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
893,Sheldon," No,  that's ridiculous."
894,Eliza,Why not ?
895,Leonard," Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go."
896,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
897,Sheldon, I am not leaving until I'm done.
898,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be done ?
899,Leonard, O-o-o-oh! .
900,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
901,Sheldon," If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
902,Eliza,"Really, if I have time to lean ?"
903,Leonard," Oh, what the hell."
904,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
905,Sheldon, Morning.
906,Eliza,Please go on.
907,Leonard, Morning.
908,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
909,Sheldon," I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
910,Eliza,Do you say you have to say for some special reason ?
911,Leonard, I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean.
912,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not surprised ?
913,Sheldon, Sarcasm?
914,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
915,Leonard, You think?
916,Eliza,"Oh, I think? ?"
917,Sheldon," Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life."
918,Eliza,Is it important that your methods may have been somewhat unorthodox ?
919,Leonard," You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
920,Eliza,What makes you think I know what you ?
921,Sheldon, You don't think that crosses a line?
922,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
923,Leonard," Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth."
924,Eliza,Your mouth ?
925,Sheldon, You have a sarcasm sign?
926,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
927,Leonard," No, I do not have a sarcasm sign."
928,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
929,Sheldon," Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs."
930,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
931,Penny, Son of a Bitch!
932,Eliza,Earlier you said your mouth .
933,Leonard, Penny's up.
934,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your methods may have been somewhat unorthodox .
935,Penny," You sick, geeky bastards!"
936,Eliza,"Oh, I sick ?"
937,Leonard, How did she know it was us?
938,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
939,Sheldon, I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
940,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
941,Penny, Leonard!
942,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
943,Leonard," God, this is going to be bad."
944,Eliza,Please go on.
945,Sheldon," Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran."
946,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
947,Penny, You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
948,Eliza,Why do you say your apartment last night what you was sleeping? ?
949,Leonard," Yes, but, only to clean."
950,Eliza,I see.
951,Sheldon," Really more to organise, you're not actually dirty, per se."
952,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be not actually dirty .
953,Penny, Give me back my key.
954,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
955,Leonard," I'm very, very sorry."
956,Eliza,Is it because you are very that you came to me ?
957,Penny, Do you understand how creepy this is.
958,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
959,Leonard," Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
960,Eliza,I understand.
961,Penny," In my apartment, while I was sleeping."
962,Eliza,Is it important that your apartment ?
963,Sheldon," And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor."
964,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
965,Penny, And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
966,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
967,Sheldon," Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!"
968,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your key ?
969,Penny, God!
970,Eliza,But your apartment last night what you was sleeping? .
971,Leonard," Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
972,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
973,Penny, Stay away from me.
974,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your apartment .
975,Leonard," Sure, that's another way to go."
976,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
977,Sheldon," Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive."
978,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
979,Leonard, You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What's funny?
980,Eliza,What makes you think I am going to march myself over there right now and apologise ?
981,Sheldon, That wasn't sarcasm?
982,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
983,Leonard, No.
984,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
985,Sheldon," Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this."
986,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am all over the place this morning ?
987,Penny, What?
988,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
989,Sheldon," I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could."
990,Eliza,How long have you been truly sorry for what happened last night ?
991,Penny," Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?"
992,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon ?
993,Raj," Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?"
994,Eliza,Your ?
995,Penny," You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?"
996,Eliza,Who else in your family shot her husband ?
997,Raj," She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me."
998,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
999,Penny," It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out."
1000,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
1001,Penny," I mean, just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?"
1002,Eliza,Why do you say your life happen to be jerks ?
1003,Raj, She asked me a question. I should probably nod.
1004,Eliza,You say She asked you a question ?
1005,Penny, That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.
1006,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
1007,Raj, Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis.
1008,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's pelvis ?
1009,Howard," Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served."
1010,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1011,Leonard, It's fine. You win.
1012,Eliza,"Oh, I win ?"
1013,Howard, What's his problem?
1014,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your life happen to be jerks ?
1015,Sheldon, His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
1016,Eliza,Earlier you said your .
1017,Howard, Been there.
1018,Eliza,But your sister shot her husband .
1019,Raj," Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny."
1020,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were in the hallway .
1021,Howard," Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?"
1022,Eliza,Please go on.
1023,Raj," Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee."
1024,Eliza,Were you really ?
1025,Leonard, What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
1026,Eliza,What do you think ?
1027,Raj," Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and... then she hugged me."
1028,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
1029,Howard, She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?
1030,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
1031,Raj," intoxicating, isn't it?"
1032,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1033,Penny, Hi.
1034,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1035,Leonard, Oh.
1036,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1037,Penny, What's going on?
1038,Eliza,Please go on.
1039,Leonard," Um, here's the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research...."
1040,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1041,Penny, Leonard.
1042,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your participation in what was .
1043,Leonard, Yeah.
1044,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1045,Penny, We're okay.
1046,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1047,Leonard, Six two inch dowels.
1048,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1049,Sheldon, Check.
1050,Eliza,Please go on.
1051,Leonard," One package, Phillips head screws."
1052,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1053,Sheldon, Check.
1054,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1055,Penny," Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre."
1056,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
1057,Leonard," No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering."
1058,Eliza,Why not ?
1059,Sheldon, Considering what? How great this place looks?
1060,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
1061,Howard," Oh boy, I was afraid of this."
1062,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were afraid of this now ?
1063,Leonard, What?
1064,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1065,Howard, These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
1066,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components ?
1067,Penny," Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store."
1068,Eliza,Please go on.
1069,Leonard," It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
1070,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1071,Sheldon, We could put her stereo back there.
1072,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1073,Leonard, And control it how?
1074,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1075,Sheldon," Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy."
1076,Eliza,Please go on.
1077,Howard," Good point, how you gonna cool it?"
1078,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
1079,Penny," Hey guys, I got this."
1080,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1081,Sheldon," Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?"
1082,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
1083,Leonard," Also inefficient, and might be loud."
1084,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1085,Howard," How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC..."
1086,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
1087,Penny," Guys, this is actually really simple."
1088,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1089,Howard," Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
1090,Eliza,Why the uncertain tone ?
1091,Leonard," Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
1092,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1093,Sheldon, And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
1094,Eliza,Do you wish that water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing ?
1095,Penny," Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes."
1096,Eliza,Is it important that your clothes ?
1097,Leonard," Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium."
1098,Eliza,What do you know about we replace panels A ?
1099,Sheldon," Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink."
1100,Eliza,Earlier you said your clothes .
1101,Howard," Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
1102,Eliza,Your lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch ?
1103,Leonard, Meet back here in an hour?
1104,Eliza,But your lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch .
1105,Howard, Done.
1106,Eliza,Please go on.
1107,Leonard, Got it. .
1108,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1109,Penny," Okay, this place does look pretty good."
1110,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1111,Howard," Alright, just a few more feet, and.... here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub."
1112,Eliza,What if they were not gentlemen ?
1113,Sheldon, Good lord!
1114,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1115,Raj, Oooh.
1116,Eliza,Please go on.
1117,Leonard," Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
1118,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
1119,Howard," Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth."
1120,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1121,Leonard," Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
1122,Eliza,"Really, my wands ?"
1123,Sheldon, Lock and load.
1124,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1125,Howard," Raj, blow up the gates."
1126,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1127,Raj," Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!"
1128,Eliza,Why do you say your God ?
1129,Howard," Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
1130,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your God ?
1131,Leonard, Stay in formation.
1132,Eliza,Please go on.
1133,Howard," Leonard, you've got one on your tail."
1134,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my tail ?
1135,Leonard," That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off."
1136,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1137,Raj, I've got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
1138,Eliza,Is it important that your meat with goblin blood! ?
1139,Leonard," Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!"
1140,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1141,Raj," Oooh, he's got me."
1142,Eliza,Earlier you said your meat with goblin blood! .
1143,Howard," Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!"
1144,Eliza,What about your own sleath spell ?
1145,Sheldon, I've got the Sword of Azeroth!
1146,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your tail's prehensile .
1147,Leonard," Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj."
1148,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1149,Sheldon," There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!"
1150,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1151,Howard, Leonard look out!
1152,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1153,Leonard," Dammit man, we're dying here."
1154,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1155,Sheldon," Goodbye, peasants."
1156,Eliza,Please go on.
1157,Leonard, The bastard teleported.
1158,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1159,Raj, He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
1160,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1161,Leonard," You betrayed us for money, who are you?"
1162,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1163,Sheldon," I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
1164,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be a rogue knight elf ?
1165,Howard, I am the Swordmaster!
1166,Eliza,Do you enjoy being the Swordmaster! ?
1167,Sheldon," Wooh, I'm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool."
1168,Eliza,Is it because you are all sweaty that you came to me ?
1169,Leonard," No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now."
1170,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1171,Howard, Sounds like your neighbour's home.
1172,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's neighbour's home ?
1173,Leonard, Excuse me.
1174,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1175,Sheldon, Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.
1176,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1177,Leonard," Oh, right, right right right right."
1178,Eliza,Please go on.
1179,Howard," Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it."
1180,Eliza,Do you say Stealing snail mail for some special reason ?
1181,Leonard," Penny, the mailman did it again, he...  Oh! Sorry."
1182,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
1183,Penny," Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard."
1184,Eliza,Your neighbour Leonard ?
1185,Doug, What's up bro.
1186,Eliza,But your neighbour Leonard .
1187,Leonard, Not much. Bro.
1188,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1189,Penny," Is, is everything okay."
1190,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1191,Leonard," Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here."
1192,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1193,Penny," Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman."
1194,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1195,Leonard," Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap."
1196,Eliza,Why not ?
1197,Penny," Okay, well, thank you, again."
1198,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
1199,Leonard," No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! ."
1200,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1201,Sheldon, Penny for your thoughts.
1202,Eliza,"Really, my thoughts ?"
1203,Raj, What's the matter.
1204,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1205,Leonard," No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and..."
1206,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1207,Howard," Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?"
1208,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
1209,Leonard, What is wrong with you?
1210,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
1211,Howard, I'm a romantic.
1212,Eliza,How long have you been a romantic ?
1213,Sheldon, Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
1214,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy ?
1215,Leonard," No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with."
1216,Eliza,How ?
1217,Howard, Because he looked better than you?
1218,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
1219,Leonard, Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
1220,Eliza,Please go on.
1221,Sheldon," Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again."
1222,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1223,Howard," I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray."
1224,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we disagree each other.
1225,Leonard," Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
1226,Eliza,Why do you say your own speed ?
1227,Raj, Like who?
1228,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your own speed ?
1229,Leonard, I don't know. Olivia Geiger?
1230,Eliza,Don't you really know ?
1231,Sheldon, The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
1232,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1233,Leonard, Yeah.
1234,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1235,Sheldon," Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability."
1236,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1237,Howard," I don't know, you guys work in the same lab."
1238,Eliza,In what way ?
1239,Leonard, So?
1240,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1241,Howard," There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm... a bit of a self-taught expert."
1242,Eliza,Possibly they are pitfalls .
1243,Leonard," Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
1244,Eliza,"Really, if you was to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner ?"
1245,Howard," Oh, then you're probably okay."
1246,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were probably okay ?
1247,Leonard, Hello Lesley.
1248,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
1249,Lesley, Hi Leonard.
1250,Eliza,Please go on.
1251,Leonard, Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
1252,Eliza,You say Lesley you would like to propose an experiment ?
1253,Lesley," Goggles, Leonard."
1254,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1255,Leonard," Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
1256,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1257,Lesley, Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles.
1258,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1259,Leonard," Pfff, I've done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay."
1260,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay .
1261,Lesley," Wait, are you asking me out?"
1262,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am asking you out? ?
1263,Leonard," I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don't need to quibble over terminology."
1264,Eliza,Were you really ?
1265,Lesley, What sort of experiment would you propose?
1266,Eliza,What do you think ?
1267,Leonard," There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock."
1268,Eliza,Do you wish to would pick I up me ?
1269,Lesley, Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
1270,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1271,Leonard," Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes."
1272,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
1273,Lesley," Well, why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable."
1274,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
1275,Leonard," You mean, kiss you now?"
1276,Eliza,"Oh, I now? ?"
1277,Lesley, Yes.
1278,Eliza,You are sure.
1279,Leonard, Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
1280,Eliza,You believe I can define the parameters of the kiss? don't you ?
1281,Lesley, Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
1282,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your cup o' noodles .
1283,Leonard, Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
1284,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1285,Lesley," No, I think it needs to be spontaneous."
1286,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1287,Lesley, What do you think.
1288,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
1289,Leonard," You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
1290,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1291,Lesley," Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal."
1292,Eliza,Why not ?
1293,Leonard, None?
1294,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1295,Lesley, None.
1296,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1297,Leonard," Ah. Well, thank you for your time."
1298,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1299,Lesley, Thank you.
1300,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
1301,Leonard, None at all?
1302,Eliza,Please go on.
1303,Howard," Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?"
1304,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I was a robot ?
1305,Sheldon," That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
1306,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
1307,Howard," Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side."
1308,Eliza,Can't you be more positive ?
1309,Sheldon," Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?"
1310,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1311,Raj, You might be bound by them right now.
1312,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1313,Howard," That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
1314,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1315,Sheldon, Of course not.
1316,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1317,Howard," Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
1318,Eliza,"Oh, I ever harmed myself ?"
1319,Sheldon," Well, no."
1320,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1321,Howard, I smell robot.
1322,Eliza,Do you say you smell robot for some special reason ?
1323,Leonard," Hey, what's going on."
1324,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1325,Sheldon, The internet's been down for half an hour.
1326,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1327,Raj," Also, Sheldon may be a robot."
1328,Eliza,Please go on.
1329,Howard," So, how did it go with Lesley?"
1330,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
1331,Leonard," Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway."
1332,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1333,Sheldon," Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it."
1334,Eliza,Do you wish that you can take it ?
1335,Raj, You could power down.
1336,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1337,Howard," Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick."
1338,Eliza,You say Well ?
1339,Class instructor," Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven."
1340,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1341,Howard," I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there, you're in for a treat."
1342,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be in for a treat .
1343,Sheldon," Oh, good lord."
1344,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1345,Leonard," You don't know me, you don't wear my chains... God, that's a good song."
1346,Eliza,Is it important that your chains ?
1347,Sheldon," If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
1348,Eliza,What do you know about I are compiling a mix CD for a double suicide ?
1349,Leonard," I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos."
1350,Eliza,You seem to need to know what me.
1351,Sheldon," Leonard, listen to me..."
1352,Eliza,Earlier you said your chains .
1353,Leonard," I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots."
1354,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be kind of torn between Einstein ?
1355,Sheldon," Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
1356,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1357,Leonard," Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat."
1358,Eliza,"Really, if it's a cute little cuddly cat ?"
1359,Sheldon," Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny."
1360,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1361,Leonard," It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me."
1362,Eliza,Please go on.
1363,Sheldon," Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out."
1364,Eliza,But you are not sure you that I have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker .
1365,Leonard," You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out."
1366,Eliza,What makes you think I am right ?
1367,Sheldon," No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat."
1368,Eliza,Your point was ?
1369,Leonard," No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out."
1370,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1371,Sheldon," Oh, goody, we're getting a cat."
1372,Eliza,But your point was .
1373,Penny," Ah, hey Leonard."
1374,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1375,Leonard," Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
1376,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I had plans for dinner ?
1377,Penny," Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?"
1378,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1379,Leonard," There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper."
1380,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1381,Penny, Supper?
1382,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1383,Leonard," Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
1384,Eliza,Do you wish that I can go ?
1385,Penny," Uh, six thirty's great."
1386,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1387,Leonard, Really? Great!
1388,Eliza,Please go on.
1389,Penny," Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys."
1390,Eliza,Do you like hanging out with anyone else ?
1391,Leonard, Us guys?
1392,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1393,Penny," You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?"
1394,Eliza,"Oh, I know ?"
1395,Leonard," They.... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu."
1396,Eliza,Did you think they might not be too many unknowns ?
1397,Penny," Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
1398,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1399,Leonard, Great. Did we say a time?
1400,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1401,Penny, Six thirty.
1402,Eliza,Please go on.
1403,Leonard, And that's still good for you.
1404,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1405,Penny, It's fine.
1406,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1407,Leonard, Cos it's not carved in stone.
1408,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1409,Penny," No, six thirty's great."
1410,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1411,Leonard, I'll get my chisel.
1412,Eliza,Why do you say your chisel ?
1413,Penny, Why?
1414,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your chisel ?
1415,Leonard," To... carve the... okay, I'll see you six thirty."
1416,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1417,Leonard, How do I look?
1418,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
1419,Sheldon, Could you be more specific?
1420,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1421,Leonard, Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
1422,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
1423,Sheldon, No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
1424,Eliza,Why not ?
1425,Leonard, Six thirty.
1426,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1427,Sheldon," Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate."
1428,Eliza,"Oh, I two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate ?"
1429,Leonard, Is it too much?
1430,Eliza,Please go on.
1431,Sheldon, Not if you're a rugby team.
1432,Eliza,What do you know about I are a rugby team ?
1433,Leonard," By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos."
1434,Eliza,"Really, if it should ever come up ?"
1435,Sheldon, Why would I join you?
1436,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
1437,Leonard," No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea."
1438,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1439,Sheldon," Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
1440,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1441,Leonard," You're right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
1442,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am right ?
1443,Sheldon," Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
1444,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1445,Leonard, You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
1446,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1447,Sheldon," If I could of, I would of."
1448,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you could of ?
1449,Leonard," I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realise, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!"
1450,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1451,Sheldon, Is the sex starting now?
1452,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your God! .
1453,Leonard, I'm having a panic attack.
1454,Eliza,Do you enjoy being having a panic attack ?
1455,Sheldon," Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
1456,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1457,Leonard," If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack."
1458,Eliza,Do you wish that you could calm down you wouldn't be having a panic attack ?
1459,Sheldon," Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
1460,Eliza,I see.
1461,Leonard, Why?
1462,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1463,Sheldon, Just do it.
1464,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1465,Leonard, Okay.
1466,Eliza,Please go on.
1467,Sheldon, Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
1468,Eliza,What about your own alpha-wave activity ?
1469,Leonard, What?
1470,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1471,Sheldon," It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
1472,Eliza,Do you really doubt you the basic science is valid ?
1473,Leonard," Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
1474,Eliza,Would you want to be kidding ?
1475,Sheldon, Me?
1476,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1477,Leonard, Yes.
1478,Eliza,I understand.
1479,Sheldon, What should I tell her.
1480,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
1481,Leonard, I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
1482,Eliza,I am sorry to hear that you are sick .
1483,Sheldon, Okay.
1484,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1485,Leonard," Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
1486,Eliza,What do you know about you want to try this again ?
1487,Sheldon, Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.
1488,Eliza,Is it because you are assuming nothing venereal that you came to me ?
1489,Leonard, Give me the phone.
1490,Eliza,Please go on.
1491,Sheldon, But I thought you wanted to cancel?
1492,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we thought each other.
1493,Leonard, I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
1494,Eliza,"Really, if you don't show up she'll still be expecting I ?"
1495,Sheldon, Why would she be expecting me?
1496,Eliza,What do you think ?
1497,Leonard," Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower."
1498,Eliza,Why do you want to take another shower ?
1499,Penny, So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
1500,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not the rest of the guys meeting us here? ?
1501,Leonard," Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet."
1502,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1503,Penny," Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy."
1504,Eliza,Is it important that your uncle just had a colonoscopy ?
1505,Leonard," You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common."
1506,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were kidding ?
1507,Penny, How?
1508,Eliza,Earlier you said your uncle just had a colonoscopy .
1509,Leonard, We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
1510,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1511,Penny," So, what's new in the world of physics?"
1512,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1513,Leonard, Nothing.
1514,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1515,Penny," Really, nothing?"
1516,Eliza,Please go on.
1517,Leonard," Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930's, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
1518,Eliza,Your idea has an internal logical consistency ?
1519,Penny, Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.
1520,Eliza,How long have you been sure things will pick up ?
1521,Leonard, What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
1522,Eliza,But your idea has an internal logical consistency .
1523,Penny," Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well."
1524,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1525,Leonard," Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend."
1526,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
1527,Penny," Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he's nice and funny, but..."
1528,Eliza,Do you say Doug? Oh for some special reason ?
1529,Waitress, Can I get you started with some drinks?
1530,Eliza,Perhaps you don't want to get I started with some drinks? .
1531,Leonard," No,  You were saying, but..."
1532,Eliza,Why not ?
1533,Penny, I'd like a drink.
1534,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1535,Leonard, Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.
1536,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1537,Penny," Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex."
1538,Eliza,"Really, I know you ?"
1539,Leonard," Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex."
1540,Eliza,Please go on.
1541,Penny," It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of... well, you know."
1542,Eliza,Why do you say your pattern ?
1543,Leonard," I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer."
1544,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be not sure that you do ?
1545,Penny," No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it."
1546,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1547,Leonard," Well, chafing, right?"
1548,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your pattern ?
1549,Penny, Emotionally.
1550,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1551,Leonard," Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it."
1552,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1553,Penny, How?
1554,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1555,Leonard, Physics. .
1556,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1557,Penny," Wow, centrifugal force!"
1558,Eliza,Please go on.
1559,Leonard," Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.  Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would"
1560,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I was riding on the olive ?
1561,Penny, Are you okay?
1562,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
1563,Leonard," Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?"
1564,Eliza,Do you enjoy being okay ?
1565,Penny, No.
1566,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1567,Leonard, I'm not okay.
1568,Eliza,Is it because you are not okay that you came to me ?
1569,Penny, Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
1570,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am sure I don't want to go to the emergency room? or not ?
1571,Leonard," No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding."
1572,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1573,Penny," I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?"
1574,Eliza,Do you wish to know me ?
1575,Leonard," Yes, but I get car sick too, so..."
1576,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
1577,Penny, Okay.
1578,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1579,Leonard," Sorry about your car, by the way."
1580,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
1581,Penny," Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window."
1582,Eliza,Why not ?
1583,Leonard, The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
1584,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1585,Penny," Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?"
1586,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1587,Leonard, Yeah.
1588,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1589,Penny, Was this supposed to be a date?
1590,Eliza,Please go on.
1591,Leonard," This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
1592,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1593,Penny," Okay, I was just checking."
1594,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were just checking now ?
1595,Leonard," When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night."
1596,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
1597,Sheldon," So, how was your date?"
1598,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
1599,Leonard, Awesome!
1600,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1601,Sheldon, Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
1602,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1603,Sheldon, I've been thinking about time travel again.
1604,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1605,Leonard," Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
1606,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
1607,Sheldon," Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I'd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
1608,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
1609,Leonard, Interesting.
1610,Eliza,Please go on.
1611,Sheldon," Yeah, it really takes the pressure off."
1612,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1613,Leonard," Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?"
1614,Eliza,You say Sounds like a breakthrough ?
1615,Sheldon," It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that."
1616,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1617,Leonard, Then I guess congratulations are in order.
1618,Eliza,Do you say Then you guess congratulations are in order for some special reason ?
1619,Sheldon," No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I'm not going to enjoy this party."
1620,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1621,Leonard," I know, I'm familiar with you."
1622,Eliza,How long have you been familiar with I ?
1623,Sheldon," At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
1624,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1625,Leonard," Yes, I was there."
1626,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were there .
1627,Sheldon," You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?"
1628,Eliza,"Oh, I know what's interesting about caves ?"
1629,Leonard, What?
1630,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1631,Sheldon, Nothing.
1632,Eliza,Please go on.
1633,Leonard," Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go."
1634,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1635,Sheldon," How's this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."
1636,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1637,Leonard, Mahalo's a nice touch.
1638,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1639,Sheldon, Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
1640,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1641,Leonard," Interesting, you should lead with that."
1642,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1643,Raj," Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America."
1644,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1645,Leonard, You don't have buffets in India?
1646,Eliza,"Oh, I don't have buffets in India? ?"
1647,Raj," Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me."
1648,Eliza,Do you wish to believe I can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save my life you ?
1649,Sheldon, Well here's an interesting turn of events.
1650,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1651,Leonard, What.  Howard brought a date?
1652,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
1653,Sheldon, A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
1654,Eliza,Please go on.
1655,Howard," Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer."
1656,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1657,Summer," I already told you, touching's extra."
1658,Eliza,You seem to need to already told me.
1659,Howard, Right. Sorry.
1660,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
1661,Leonard," Here comes our new boss, be polite."
1662,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your special lady friend .
1663,Gablehouser," Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser."
1664,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1665,Howard, Howard Wolowitz.
1666,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1667,Gablehouser," Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?"
1668,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1669,Sheldon, An actual real scientist.  How was that?
1670,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
1671,Sheldon, I can't believe he fired me.
1672,Eliza,Have you tried ?
1673,Leonard," Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
1674,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1675,Sheldon," In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
1676,Eliza,Is it important that your defence ?
1677,Leonard, Morning
1678,Eliza,Earlier you said your defence .
1679,Sheldon, Morning.
1680,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1681,Leonard, You're making eggs for breakfast?
1682,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be making eggs for breakfast? .
1683,Sheldon," This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment."
1684,Eliza,Please go on.
1685,Leonard, Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
1686,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1687,Sheldon," I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
1688,Eliza,Your hypothesis ?
1689,Leonard, Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
1690,Eliza,You say Sounds yummy ?
1691,Sheldon, As do I.
1692,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1693,Leonard," You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back."
1694,Eliza,Do you wish that I just apologised to Gablehauser he would give I my job back ?
1695,Sheldon," I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it."
1696,Eliza,Why do you say your first day off in decades ?
1697,Leonard, Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
1698,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1699,Sheldon," I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs."
1700,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1701,Leonard, And we all thank you.
1702,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
1703,Sheldon, Use new eggs. .
1704,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your eggs .
1705,Penny," Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?"
1706,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be running out to the market ?
1707,Sheldon," Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
1708,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your first day off in decades ?
1709,Penny, I'm sorry?
1710,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sorry? ?
1711,Sheldon, I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
1712,Eliza,Suppose you got eggs soon ?
1713,Penny, Four dozen?
1714,Eliza,But your hypothesis .
1715,Sheldon," Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
1716,Eliza,You are sure.
1717,Penny," Okay, one more time?"
1718,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1719,Sheldon," Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you."
1720,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1721,Penny," Oh, yay!"
1722,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1723,Penny, How come you didn't go into work today.
1724,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
1725,Sheldon," I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds."
1726,Eliza,Is it because you are taking a sabbatical that you came to me ?
1727,Penny," So you got canned, huh?"
1728,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1729,Sheldon, Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
1730,Eliza,Please go on.
1731,Penny," Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens."
1732,Eliza,You aren't sure ?
1733,Sheldon," No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved."
1734,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1735,Penny," No, no, I meant..."
1736,Eliza,Why not ?
1737,Sheldon, Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
1738,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1739,Penny, Never mind.
1740,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1741,Sheldon," Slow down. Slow down, please slow down."
1742,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1743,Penny, We're fine.
1744,Eliza,Please go on.
1745,Sheldon," Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
1746,Eliza,What makes you think I am not leaving myself enough space between cars ?
1747,Penny," Oh, sure I am."
1748,Eliza,How long have you been ?
1749,Sheldon," No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
1750,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1751,Penny, 120?
1752,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1753,Sheldon," Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
1754,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
1755,Penny," Well, yeah."
1756,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1757,Sheldon," Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb."
1758,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1759,Penny," Let's say 4,390."
1760,Eliza,Please go on.
1761,Sheldon," Fine. We're travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and... oh look, they built a new put-put course."
1762,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
1763,Sheldon," This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives."
1764,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1765,Penny, Thank you.
1766,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1767,Sheldon," No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
1768,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1769,Penny," Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs."
1770,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1771,Sheldon," Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
1772,Eliza,I see.
1773,Penny," Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then."
1774,Eliza,Don't you know ?
1775,Sheldon," No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit."
1776,Eliza,Why not ?
1777,Penny, Interesting.
1778,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1779,Sheldon, Isn't it?
1780,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1781,Penny," No, I mean what you find enjoyable."
1782,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
1783,Sheldon, Oh boy.
1784,Eliza,Please go on.
1785,Penny, What now?
1786,Eliza,What do you think ?
1787,Sheldon," Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine."
1788,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
1789,Penny," Well, maybe that's what I was going for."
1790,Eliza,Were you really ?
1791,Sheldon, Well then you'll want some manganese.
1792,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1793,Sheldon, That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
1794,Eliza,You don't seem quite certain.
1795,Penny," Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today."
1796,Eliza,Why don't you know Sheldon ?
1797,Sheldon," Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time."
1798,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't sure ?
1799,Penny, What?
1800,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1801,Sheldon," Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
1802,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years ?
1803,Penny, You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
1804,Eliza,Suppose I did want you -- what would that mean ?
1805,Sheldon," Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
1806,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
1807,Penny," Okay, I'm not talking about this with you."
1808,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not talking about this with I ?
1809,Sheldon," Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we're talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we're still on for put-put golf, right?"
1810,Eliza,What do you know about I assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle ?
1811,Leonard," Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something."
1812,Eliza,Do you say Hey for some special reason ?
1813,Sheldon, I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
1814,Eliza,Do you really think so ?
1815,Leonard, What's with the fish?
1816,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1817,Sheldon, It's an experiment.
1818,Eliza,Please go on.
1819,Leonard, What happened to your scrambled egg research?
1820,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
1821,Sheldon," Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be."
1822,Eliza,What if they were not as good as they're ever going to be ?
1823,Leonard, So... fish.
1824,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1825,Sheldon," I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."
1826,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1827,Leonard, Fish nightlights.
1828,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1829,Sheldon, It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
1830,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1831,Leonard," Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back."
1832,Eliza,Perhaps I am sure I don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get my job back in your fantasies.
1833,Sheldon," Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do."
1834,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
1835,Leonard, Like luminous fish.
1836,Eliza,Please go on.
1837,Sheldon, Shhhhh!
1838,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1839,Leonard, Right... I didn't....
1840,Eliza,You say Right ?
1841,Sheldon," That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we're going to be rich."
1842,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1843,Leonard, Thank you for coming on such short notice.
1844,Eliza,"Oh, I for coming on such short notice ?"
1845,Mrs Cooper, You did the right thing calling.
1846,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1847,Leonard," I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one."
1848,Eliza,Do you say you didn't know what else to do for some special reason ?
1849,Sheldon, Mommy.
1850,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1851,Mrs Cooper, Hi baby.
1852,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1853,Sheldon, You called my mother?
1854,Eliza,Is it important that your mother? ?
1855,Mrs Cooper," Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice."
1856,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1857,Sheldon, Thank you.
1858,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1859,Mrs Cooper," Honey, why did you get a loom?"
1860,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
1861,Sheldon," I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?"
1862,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were working with luminous fish now ?
1863,Mrs Cooper, Leonard called me.
1864,Eliza,Earlier you said your mother? .
1865,Sheldon," I know, but why?"
1866,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1867,Leonard, Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
1868,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
1869,Sheldon," This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother."
1870,Eliza,Please go on.
1871,Leonard," Really, when was the last time you left the house."
1872,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
1873,Sheldon, I went to the market with Penny.
1874,Eliza,You say you went to the market with Penny ?
1875,Leonard, That was three weeks ago.
1876,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1877,Sheldon," Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby."
1878,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1879,Mrs Cooper," Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you."
1880,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's little friend is concerned about I ?
1881,Sheldon," Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother."
1882,Eliza,Your mother ?
1883,Leonard, Where are you going?
1884,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am going? ?
1885,Sheldon," To my room, and no-one's allowed in."
1886,Eliza,Your room ?
1887,Mrs Cooper, He gets his temper from his daddy.
1888,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your room ?
1889,Leonard, Oh.
1890,Eliza,But your mother .
1891,Mrs Cooper, He's got my eyes.
1892,Eliza,Why do you say your eyes ?
1893,Leonard, I see.
1894,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
1895,Mrs Cooper," All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus."
1896,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your eyes .
1897,Leonard, Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
1898,Eliza,"Really, my mum made dinner ?"
1899,Sheldon, I'm not hungry.
1900,Eliza,Is it because you are not hungry that you came to me ?
1901,Mrs Cooper," Oh, Leonard, don't trouble yourself, he's stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture."
1902,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1903,Penny, Are we so sure that's a bad thing?
1904,Eliza,Possibly they are we so sure that's a bad thing? .
1905,Mrs Cooper," I'll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart."
1906,Eliza,Do you say I'll tell ya for some special reason ?
1907,Howard," Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
1908,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
1909,Mrs Cooper," Oh, honey that ain't going to work, but you keep trying.  I made chicken, I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it's a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it."
1910,Eliza,"Oh, I know ?"
1911,Leonard," That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"
1912,Eliza,Did you think they might not be we going to do anything about Sheldon? ?
1913,Mrs Cooper," Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon."
1914,Eliza,Does someone else believe I have to take my time with Sheldon you ?
1915,Leonard, Sounds like a wise man.
1916,Eliza,Please go on.
1917,Mrs Cooper," Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove."
1918,Eliza,Can you think of anyone in particular ?
1919,Penny, Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
1920,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1921,Mrs Cooper," Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it's against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed."
1922,Eliza,Does thinking of one summer what he was thirteen bring anything else to mind ?
1923,Penny, What happened?
1924,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
1925,Mrs Cooper," Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray."
1926,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1927,Leonard, A death ray?
1928,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1929,Mrs Cooper," Well, that's what he called it, didn't even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple."
1930,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
1931,Leonard," No, we're not, we're not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that.... are friends."
1932,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
1933,Mrs Cooper, Did I pluck a nerve there?
1934,Eliza,You say Did you pluck a nerve there? ?
1935,Howard, Oh yeah.
1936,Eliza,Please go on.
1937,Mrs Cooper," Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat.  Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker.  Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with “In Jesus' Name” but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you."
1938,Eliza,"Who, for example?"
1939,Penny," Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had."
1940,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
1941,Mrs Cooper, It was always Sheldon' s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?
1942,Eliza,Can you think of a specific example ?
1943,Penny, Love?
1944,Eliza,Earlier you said your God .
1945,Mrs Cooper, Lard.
1946,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1947,Howard," Hey, look who's come out...."
1948,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1949,Mrs Cooper," Shhh! You'll spook him. He's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you."
1950,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
1951,Leonard," This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You're a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room."
1952,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were a physicist ?
1953,Mrs Cooper," You don't hunt, do you?"
1954,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
1955,Mrs Cooper," Good morning, snicker-doodle."
1956,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1957,Sheldon, Morning.
1958,Eliza,Please go on.
1959,Mrs Cooper," Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?"
1960,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
1961,Sheldon, It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
1962,Eliza,Is it important that your idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form ?
1963,Mrs Cooper," But intelligently designed by a creator, right?"
1964,Eliza,But your idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form .
1965,Sheldon," What do you want, mom?"
1966,Eliza,What do you think ?
1967,Mrs Cooper, You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
1968,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
1969,Sheldon, Yeah.
1970,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
1971,Mrs Cooper," Well, I'm done fishing.  You put those on."
1972,Eliza,How long have you been done fishing ?
1973,Sheldon, What for?
1974,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
1975,Mrs Cooper," Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back."
1976,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
1977,Sheldon, No.
1978,Eliza,Why not ?
1979,Mrs Cooper," I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”"
1980,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
1981,Sheldon," I'm not going to apologise, I didn't say anything that wasn't true."
1982,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not going to apologise ?
1983,Mrs Cooper," Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out."
1984,Eliza,Are you thinking of a very special person ?
1985,Sheldon, Why not?
1986,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
1987,Mrs Cooper," Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off."
1988,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
1989,Sheldon, Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
1990,Eliza,"Really, if that stupid death ray had worked ?"
1991,Mrs Cooper, Problem solved.
1992,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
1993,Leonard, Really? That's impressive.
1994,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
1995,Mrs Cooper," Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup."
1996,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not dumb as soup ?
1997,Mrs Cooper," Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?"
1998,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
1999,Gablehouser," Well, actually...."
2000,Eliza,Please go on.
2001,Mrs Cooper," Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here."
2002,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2003,Sheldon, Dr Gablehouser.
2004,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2005,Gablehouser, Dr Cooper.
2006,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2007,Mrs Cooper," Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight."
2008,Eliza,Please go on.
2009,Sheldon," Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out."
2010,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were wrong .
2011,Gablehouser," I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser."
2012,Eliza,Is it because you are sorry that you came to me ?
2013,Mrs Cooper," Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom."
2014,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2015,Gablehouser," Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager."
2016,Eliza,"Oh, I was a teenager ?"
2017,Mrs Cooper," Oh, aren't you sweet, his father's dead."
2018,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2019,Gablehouser, Recently?
2020,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2021,Mrs Cooper, Long enough.
2022,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2023,Gablehouser," Please. Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?"
2024,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2025,Sheldon, Okay.
2026,Eliza,Please go on.
2027,Leonard," Hey, how did it go?"
2028,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2029,Sheldon, I got my job back.
2030,Eliza,Your job back ?
2031,Leonard, Really? What happened?
2032,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2033,Sheldon, I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
2034,Eliza,How long have you been not quite sure ?
2035,Leonard, That narrows it down.
2036,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your job back ?
2037,Mrs Cooper," I'm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today."
2038,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be very proud of I honey ?
2039,Sheldon," Thanks, mom. Mom?"
2040,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2041,Mrs Cooper, Mmm-hmm?
2042,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2043,Sheldon, Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
2044,Eliza,Why do you say your new daddy? ?
2045,Mrs Cooper, We'll see. Sleep tight.
2046,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your new daddy? .
2047,Sheldon," Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg."
2048,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2049,Howard," Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla."
2050,Eliza,Earlier you said your infantry division .
2051,Leonard," No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk."
2052,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2053,Raj, Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
2054,Eliza,Do you believe I don't just have Robert E ?
2055,Penny," Hi, you guys ready to order?"
2056,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2057,Howard," Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?"
2058,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2059,Leonard, And Orcs!
2060,Eliza,Please go on.
2061,Penny, I'll be back.
2062,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2063,Raj," Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps."
2064,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
2065,Penny," Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back."
2066,Eliza,Is it important that your boss says I either have to order ?
2067,Howard, What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
2068,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
2069,Penny, A shower.
2070,Eliza,But your boss says I either have to order .
2071,Howard, I'll take the heart smart platter.
2072,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2073,Penny," Alright, thank you, and Sheldon."
2074,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
2075,Sheldon," We don't eat here, I don't know what's good."
2076,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know what's good ?
2077,Penny," Well, it's all good."
2078,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2079,Sheldon, Statistically unlikely.
2080,Eliza,Please go on.
2081,Leonard," Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
2082,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2083,Sheldon," I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here."
2084,Eliza,Do you like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers anyone else ?
2085,Leonard, I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
2086,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sorry ?
2087,Penny," Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?"
2088,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2089,Sheldon, Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
2090,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2091,Penny, The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
2092,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
2093,Sheldon," Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"
2094,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
2095,Penny, Because you are not at Big Boy!
2096,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
2097,Sheldon," Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger."
2098,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2099,Leonard, Make it two.
2100,Eliza,Please go on.
2101,Sheldon, Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
2102,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2103,Lesley," Hey Leonard, hi guys."
2104,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2105,Leonard, Hey Lesley.
2106,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2107,Lesley, I didn't know you ate here.
2108,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we didn't know each other.
2109,Sheldon, We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.
2110,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2111,Leonard," Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me."
2112,Eliza,Please go on.
2113,Howard, And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
2114,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2115,Penny," Howard, I've asked you not to do that."
2116,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2117,Leonard, Lesley and I do research together at the University.
2118,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
2119,Penny," Oh, wow, a girl scientist."
2120,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2121,Lesley," Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I'm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist."
2122,Eliza,How have I helped you to be glad ?
2123,Leonard, What happened to Elliot Wong?
2124,Eliza,What do you think ?
2125,Lesley," He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?"
2126,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am in? or not ?
2127,Leonard," Yeah, sure, why not."
2128,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
2129,Lesley," Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place."
2130,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my place ?
2131,Leonard, Why at my place?
2132,Eliza,Your place? ?
2133,Lesley," Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you."
2134,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
2135,Penny," Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?"
2136,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2137,Leonard," Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough."
2138,Eliza,Why do you say your parents felt that naming you Leonard and putting you in advanced placement classes wasn't getting you beaten up enough ?
2139,Howard," If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox."
2140,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I are into music ?
2141,Penny," Really?  I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two."
2142,Eliza,Is it because you are actually not that into music that you came to me ?
2143,Leonard," Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
2144,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2145,Sheldon," He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure."
2146,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your parents felt that naming you Leonard and putting you in advanced placement classes wasn't getting you beaten up enough .
2147,Leonard, Thank you Sheldon.
2148,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2149,Sheldon," Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
2150,Eliza,How long have you been sorry ?
2151,Penny," Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple."
2152,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2153,Raj, Oh dear.
2154,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your place? ?
2155,Howard, What's the matter?
2156,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2157,Raj, She didn't take my order.
2158,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2159,Howard, How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.
2160,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
2161,Raj," Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip."
2162,Eliza,Earlier you said your order .
2163,Leonard," What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?"
2164,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
2165,Sheldon," Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable."
2166,Eliza,Do you wish to assume she meant that the two of I together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute me ?
2167,Leonard," If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available."
2168,Eliza,Do you wish that Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned you down then that would unambiguously mean that she ?
2169,Sheldon," You're a lucky man, Leonard."
2170,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be a lucky man .
2171,Leonard, How so?
2172,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2173,Sheldon, You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
2174,Eliza,What makes you think I am talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought ?
2175,Leonard," Well, what do you think."
2176,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2177,Sheldon," I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared."
2178,Eliza,Do you say you said you could follow it for some special reason ?
2179,Lesley, I admire your fingering.
2180,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
2181,Leonard, Thank you.
2182,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
2183,Lesley, Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.
2184,Eliza,Is it important that your instrument ?
2185,Lesley," Goodnight guys, good job."
2186,Eliza,But your instrument .
2187,Male string quartettist, Thanks.
2188,Eliza,Please go on.
2189,Female string quartettist, See you next week.
2190,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2191,Leonard," That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me."
2192,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2193,Lesley, You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.
2194,Eliza,What do you know about I are up for it we could practise that middle section again ?
2195,Leonard," Uh, sure, why not."
2196,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
2197,Lesley," Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available."
2198,Eliza,Why do you think I understand that you ?
2199,Leonard, Really?
2200,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2201,Lesley," Yeah, I'm good to go."
2202,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be good to go ?
2203,Leonard, I thought you weren't interested in me.
2204,Eliza,You seem to need to thought me.
2205,Lesley, That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
2206,Eliza,Do you saw anyone else ?
2207,Leonard, You mean my cello?
2208,Eliza,Your cello? ?
2209,Lesley," No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you."
2210,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2211,Leonard, No kidding?
2212,Eliza,Why not ?
2213,Lesley," What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?"
2214,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
2215,Leonard," Gee, uh..."
2216,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your cello? ?
2217,Lesley, Is it the waitress?
2218,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2219,Leonard, Penny? What about her?
2220,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
2221,Lesley," Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction."
2222,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we saw my pupils dilate what I looked at her each other.
2223,Leonard," Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up."
2224,Eliza,Why do you say your pupils ?
2225,Lesley, You and the waitress then?
2226,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2227,Leonard," No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me."
2228,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2229,Lesley," So, you're open to a sexual relationship?"
2230,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am open to a sexual relationship? ?
2231,Leonard," Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am."
2232,Eliza,Do you enjoy being ?
2233,Lesley, Good.
2234,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your pupils .
2235,Leonard," Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?"
2236,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2237,Lesley, Why don't we finish the section first.
2238,Eliza,What do you think ?
2239,Leonard, Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
2240,Eliza,Please go on.
2241,Leonard," I'm good, I'm good to go."
2242,Eliza,Is it because you are good to go that you came to me ?
2243,Lesley, Me too.
2244,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2245,Penny," Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?"
2246,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2247,Sheldon, I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
2248,Eliza,What if you never got my opinion on a matter of semiotics ?
2249,Penny, I'm sorry?
2250,Eliza,How long have you been sorry? ?
2251,Sheldon," Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
2252,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2253,Penny," Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not."
2254,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were really not ?
2255,Sheldon, Just come with me.
2256,Eliza,Please go on.
2257,Sheldon, Well?
2258,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2259,Penny, Well what?
2260,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2261,Sheldon, What does it mean?
2262,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
2263,Penny," Oh, come on, you went to college."
2264,Eliza,"Oh, I went to college ?"
2265,Sheldon," Yes, but I was eleven."
2266,Eliza,Were you really ?
2267,Penny," Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy."
2268,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
2269,Sheldon, So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
2270,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be saying Leonard has a girl in there .
2271,Penny," Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams."
2272,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2273,Lesley," Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast."
2274,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2275,Penny, We really shouldn't be standing here.
2276,Eliza,Please go on.
2277,Sheldon, This is very awkward.
2278,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2279,Penny," Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?"
2280,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2281,Sheldon," Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse."
2282,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse now ?
2283,Penny," Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?"
2284,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2285,Sheldon," I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide."
2286,Eliza,You say you didn't have to ?
2287,Penny," So, do you know who's in there?"
2288,Eliza,"Oh, I know who's in there? ?"
2289,Sheldon," Well, there's Leonard.  And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster."
2290,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2291,Penny," Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night."
2292,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2293,Sheldon," No, no, wait, hold on."
2294,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2295,Penny, What's the matter?
2296,Eliza,Please go on.
2297,Sheldon," I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?"
2298,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
2299,Penny," Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie."
2300,Eliza,What makes you think I am asking the wrong girl ?
2301,Sheldon," Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley."
2302,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2303,Sheldon," Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!"
2304,Eliza,Is it important that your board ?
2305,Leonard," Hey, what's the matter?"
2306,Eliza,But your board .
2307,Sheldon," My equations, someone's tampered with my equations."
2308,Eliza,Your equations ?
2309,Leonard, Are you sure?
2310,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't sure? ?
2311,Sheldon," Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign's been changed."
2312,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sure ?
2313,Leonard, Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
2314,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your equations ?
2315,Sheldon," Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you.... hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having."
2316,Eliza,Perhaps I am in your fantasies.
2317,Lesley, You're welcome.
2318,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am welcome ?
2319,Sheldon, You did this?
2320,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2321,Lesley," Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?"
2322,Eliza,Do you wish to fixed it me ?
2323,Sheldon, Cool?
2324,Eliza,Earlier you said your best to Lesley .
2325,Lesley," Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night."
2326,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
2327,Leonard," Thank you, I'll see you at work."
2328,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2329,Sheldon," Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
2330,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2331,Lesley, What?
2332,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2333,Sheldon, Who told you you could touch my board?
2334,Eliza,Why do you say your board? ?
2335,Lesley, No-one.
2336,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your board? .
2337,Sheldon, I don't come into your house and touch your board.
2338,Eliza,Don't you really come into my house and touch my board ?
2339,Lesley, There are no incorrect equations on my board.
2340,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2341,Sheldon," Oh, that is so... so..."
2342,Eliza,Earlier you said your board .
2343,Lesley," I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. ."
2344,Eliza,"Really, if I come up with an adjective ?"
2345,Sheldon," Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate."
2346,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2347,Leonard," You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right."
2348,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2349,Sheldon," I'm not staring, I'm mulling."
2350,Eliza,Do you enjoy being mulling ?
2351,Penny," Oh, hey Leonard."
2352,Eliza,Please go on.
2353,Leonard," Oh, hi."
2354,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2355,Penny," So, how's it going?"
2356,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2357,Leonard, Pretty good.
2358,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2359,Penny," Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good."
2360,Eliza,"Oh, I was doing very good ?"
2361,Leonard," Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
2362,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2363,Penny," Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night."
2364,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2365,Leonard, Sheldon!
2366,Eliza,Please go on.
2367,Sheldon, I'm coming.
2368,Eliza,Is it because you are coming that you came to me ?
2369,Penny," So, is it serious, do you like her?"
2370,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
2371,Leonard," Wuh, I don't.... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not.... Sheldon, we have to go!"
2372,Eliza,How long have you been not ?
2373,Sheldon," Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse."
2374,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse ?
2375,Penny," Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard."
2376,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2377,Leonard," Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
2378,Eliza,Do you think its likely that the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy ?
2379,Sheldon, Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
2380,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2381,Leonard," You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent."
2382,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
2383,Sheldon, She's not that intelligent.
2384,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2385,Leonard, She fixed your equation.
2386,Eliza,What about your own equation ?
2387,Sheldon, She got lucky.
2388,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2389,Leonard, You don't believe in luck.
2390,Eliza,"Oh, I don't believe in luck ?"
2391,Sheldon, I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
2392,Eliza,Why don't you have to believe in it for her to be lucky ?
2393,Leonard," Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy."
2394,Eliza,Has your treatment made you happy ?
2395,Sheldon, Leonard?
2396,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2397,Leonard, Yeah.
2398,Eliza,Please go on.
2399,Sheldon, I still don't care.
2400,Eliza,Do you say you still don't care for some special reason ?
2401,Leonard," Hey, Lesley."
2402,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2403,Lesley," Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero."
2404,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2405,Leonard, Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
2406,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
2407,Lesley, Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
2408,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
2409,Leonard, So anyway  Hello.
2410,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
2411,Lesley," Uh, what are you doing?"
2412,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
2413,Leonard, Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
2414,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2415,Lesley," Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?"
2416,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2417,Leonard," I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt."
2418,Eliza,But you are not sure you .
2419,Lesley," Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death."
2420,Eliza,What if they were not neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex ?
2421,Leonard, Who wouldn't?
2422,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2423,Lesley," Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in."
2424,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2425,Leonard," Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?"
2426,Eliza,What makes you glad just now ?
2427,Lesley," Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years."
2428,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be probably good till New Years ?
2429,Leonard, Oh. Okay. Thank you.
2430,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2431,Lesley, Thank you!
2432,Eliza,Please go on.
2433,Leonard, You want to make plans for New Years.
2434,Eliza,"Oh, I want to make plans for New Years ?"
2435,Lesley," Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me."
2436,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be smothering you .
2437,Leonard, Sorry.
2438,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
2439,Howard," Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!"
2440,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2441,Leonard, Doctor what?
2442,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2443,Howard, The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.
2444,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2445,Leonard, Wha... how did it get on the internet?
2446,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2447,Howard, I put it there.
2448,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
2449,Leonard," Well, how did you know about it?"
2450,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
2451,Raj, A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
2452,Eliza,What makes you think I am a magnificent beast ?
2453,Leonard," Well, that part's true!"
2454,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2455,Sheldon," You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."
2456,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2457,Leonard, No kidding.
2458,Eliza,Why not ?
2459,Sheldon," I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger."
2460,Eliza,Is it important that your new Tuesday hamburger ?
2461,Leonard, Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
2462,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted ?
2463,Sheldon," Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation."
2464,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays .
2465,Leonard, Really?
2466,Eliza,But your new Tuesday hamburger .
2467,Sheldon," Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup."
2468,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
2469,Penny," So, how's everything."
2470,Eliza,Please go on.
2471,Sheldon," Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
2472,Eliza,You say Terrific ?
2473,Penny," Really, oh yay!"
2474,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2475,Sheldon, Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
2476,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
2477,Penny," Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?"
2478,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know ?
2479,Leonard," Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out."
2480,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
2481,Penny," Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. ."
2482,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sure there is someone out there who is just right for I ?
2483,Leonard, Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
2484,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
2485,Sheldon, You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
2486,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2487,Leonard, Are you even listening to me?
2488,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am even listening to me? ?
2489,Sheldon," Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
2490,Eliza,Is it because you are listening that you came to me ?
2491,Leonard," Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. ."
2492,Eliza,"Oh, I can grow the ingredients for soup ?"
2493,Raj," Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball."
2494,Eliza,Do you wish that no-one else will say it ?
2495,Howard, That was absolutely humiliating.
2496,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2497,Leonard," Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
2498,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2499,Howard," Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party."
2500,Eliza,I understand.
2501,Leonard," I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews."
2502,Eliza,Do you say you think we have to acknowledge for some special reason ?
2503,Sheldon," You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command."
2504,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2505,Leonard," Sheldon, let it go."
2506,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2507,Sheldon," No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back."
2508,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2509,Howard," I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster."
2510,Eliza,You seem to need to shot I for good reason me.
2511,Sheldon," I was giving clear, concise orders."
2512,Eliza,Were you really ?
2513,Leonard," You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
2514,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2515,Penny," Oh, hey guys."
2516,Eliza,Please go on.
2517,Leonard, Hello Penny.
2518,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
2519,Howard, Morning ma'am.
2520,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2521,Penny," So, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
2522,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
2523,Sheldon," Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
2524,Eliza,What do you know about I consider being fragged by my own troops fun ?
2525,Penny," Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by."
2526,Eliza,"Really, if I guys are around I should come by ?"
2527,Leonard, A party?
2528,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2529,Penny, Yeah.
2530,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2531,Howard, A boy-girl party?
2532,Eliza,Please go on.
2533,Penny," Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing..."
2534,Eliza,Your friends ?
2535,Sheldon, Dancing?
2536,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friends ?
2537,Leonard," Yeah, I don't know, Penny..."
2538,Eliza,Don't you really know ?
2539,Sheldon," The thing is, we're not...."
2540,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2541,Leonard, We're really more....
2542,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2543,Sheldon, No.
2544,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2545,Leonard," But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
2546,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2547,Penny," Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween."
2548,Eliza,What do you think ?
2549,Sheldon, A Halloween party?
2550,Eliza,Please go on.
2551,Howard," As in, costumes?"
2552,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2553,Penny," Well, yeah."
2554,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2555,Leonard, Is there a theme?
2556,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2557,Penny," Um, yeah, Halloween."
2558,Eliza,Please go on.
2559,Sheldon," Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?"
2560,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
2561,Penny," As usual, I'm not following."
2562,Eliza,How long have you been not following ?
2563,Leonard," He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy..."
2564,Eliza,Do you think its likely that we can come as anyone from science-fiction ?
2565,Penny, Sure.
2566,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2567,Sheldon, What about comic-books?
2568,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
2569,Penny, Fine.
2570,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2571,Sheldon, Anime?
2572,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2573,Penny, Of course.
2574,Eliza,Please go on.
2575,Sheldon," TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods..."
2576,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2577,Penny," Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye."
2578,Eliza,"Oh, I want ?"
2579,Howard," Gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
2580,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2581,Leonard, I'll get it.
2582,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2583,Howard, Bjow
2584,Eliza,Please go on.
2585,Leonard," Oh, no."
2586,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2587,Sheldon, Oh no!
2588,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2589,Raj, Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
2590,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2591,Sheldon," See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting."
2592,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
2593,Leonard," We all have other costumes, we can change."
2594,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2595,Raj," Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast."
2596,Eliza,Please go on.
2597,Howard," No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo."
2598,Eliza,Why not ?
2599,Leonard," Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?"
2600,Eliza,"Who, may I ask ?"
2601,All, Agreed.
2602,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2603,Leonard, I call Frodo!
2604,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
2605,All, Damn!
2606,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2607,Raj," Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
2608,Eliza,Why do you say your hammer got stuck in the door on the bus ?
2609,Leonard, You went with Thor?
2610,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2611,Raj," What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect."
2612,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
2613,Howard," I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood."
2614,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be Robin Hood ?
2615,Raj," Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man."
2616,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
2617,Leonard," Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
2618,Eliza,What would getting to talk to I about before we go to the party mean to you ?
2619,Sheldon," I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect."
2620,Eliza,Do you wish that anybody gets it ?
2621,Leonard," No, it's not..."
2622,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2623,Sheldon," If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
2624,Eliza,What do you know about you have to ?
2625,Leonard," Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight."
2626,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2627,Sheldon," Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
2628,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
2629,Leonard," For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey."
2630,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
2631,Sheldon," Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting."
2632,Eliza,"Really, my bed-wetting ?"
2633,Leonard, All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.
2634,Eliza,How ?
2635,Howard," Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver."
2636,Eliza,"Really, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in your quiver ?"
2637,Penny," Oh, hey guys."
2638,Eliza,Earlier you said your first chance for Penny to see you in the context of her social group .
2639,Leonard," Hey, sorry we're late."
2640,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
2641,Sheldon, And you said the party starts at seven.
2642,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2643,Penny," Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven."
2644,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2645,Penny," Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in."
2646,Eliza,You are sure.
2647,Howard," What, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
2648,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2649,Penny," Probably, but in their own homes."
2650,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your hammer got stuck in the door on the bus .
2651,Sheldon, So what time does the costume parade start?
2652,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
2653,Penny, The parade?
2654,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2655,Sheldon," Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
2656,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2657,Penny," Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes."
2658,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes ?
2659,Sheldon, This party is just going to suck.
2660,Eliza,Please go on.
2661,Penny," No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute."
2662,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2663,Leonard," Actually, Penny, he's Rob..."
2664,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2665,Howard, I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
2666,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
2667,Penny," No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be."
2668,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2669,Leonard," Oh, he's the Doppler Effect."
2670,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2671,Sheldon, Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
2672,Eliza,I see.
2673,Penny," Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable."
2674,Eliza,Do you see it now anyone else ?
2675,Leonard, Okay.
2676,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2677,Sheldon," See, people get it."
2678,Eliza,Please go on.
2679,Raj," Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix."
2680,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2681,Howard," No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights."
2682,Eliza,Why not ?
2683,Sheldon," I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?"
2684,Eliza,Do you think its likely that there's no costume parade ?
2685,Leonard, We're socialising. Meeting new people.
2686,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2687,Sheldon, Telepathically?
2688,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2689,Penny," Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!"
2690,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
2691,Raj," Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's."
2692,Eliza,You say Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume you have ever seen ?
2693,Leonard," She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat."
2694,Eliza,Please go on.
2695,Sheldon, And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
2696,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2697,Howard," Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough."
2698,Eliza,Is it important that your head and cough ?
2699,Raj, What is your move?
2700,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
2701,Howard," I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together."
2702,Eliza,Your hair back ?
2703,Leonard, Where do you get this stuff?
2704,Eliza,"Oh, I get this stuff? ?"
2705,Howard," You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls."
2706,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2707,Raj," Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men."
2708,Eliza,Do you wish that only you had his confidence ?
2709,Howard," If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat."
2710,Eliza,What do you know about that's a working stethoscope ?
2711,Nurse Costume Girl, No thanks.
2712,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2713,Howard," No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
2714,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2715,Leonard," I  want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people."
2716,Eliza,Why don't you know what to talk to these people ?
2717,Sheldon," Well, I actually might be able to help."
2718,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
2719,Leonard, How so?
2720,Eliza,What do you think ?
2721,Sheldon," Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will."
2722,Eliza,"Really, if I will ?"
2723,Leonard, Go on.
2724,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your hair back ?
2725,Sheldon," Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”"
2726,Eliza,Why do you say 'am' ?
2727,Leonard, Then what happens?
2728,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
2729,Sheldon, That's as far as I've gotten.
2730,Eliza,But your head and cough .
2731,Leonard," This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in."
2732,Eliza,Is it because you are jumping in that you came to me ?
2733,Sheldon, Good luck.
2734,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2735,Leonard," No, you're coming with me."
2736,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2737,Sheldon," Oh, I hardly think so."
2738,Eliza,Do you say Oh for some special reason ?
2739,Leonard, Come on.
2740,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2741,Sheldon, Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
2742,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2743,Leonard, Yes. But I need a wing-man.
2744,Eliza,I understand.
2745,Sheldon," Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage."
2746,Eliza,Do you think its likely that we're going to use flight metaphors you are much more suited to being the guy from the FAA ?
2747,Girl in Hippie Costume," Oh, Hi!"
2748,Eliza,Please go on.
2749,Leonard, Hi.
2750,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2751,Sheldon, Hello.
2752,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
2753,Girl," So, what are you supposed to be?"
2754,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
2755,Sheldon, Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
2756,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2757,Girl," Uh, a choo-choo train?"
2758,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2759,Sheldon, Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
2760,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2761,Girl, A brain damaged choo-choo train?
2762,Eliza,Please go on.
2763,Girl in Butterfly Costume, How wasted am I?
2764,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
2765,Sheldon, Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
2766,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2767,Girl, I still don't get it.
2768,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
2769,Sheldon, I'm the Doppler Effect.
2770,Eliza,How long have you been the Doppler Effect ?
2771,Girl," Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive."
2772,Eliza,Do you wish that that is some sort of learning disability ?
2773,Leonard, Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
2774,Eliza,Perhaps I will just tell people I are a zebra? in good time.
2775,Sheldon," Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves."
2776,Eliza,Should you just tell people I are one of the seven dwarves yourself ?
2777,Leonard, Because I'm Frodo.
2778,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
2779,Sheldon," Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect."
2780,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
2781,Leonard, Oh no.
2782,Eliza,Why not ?
2783,Sheldon, What?
2784,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2785,Leonard, That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
2786,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2787,Sheldon, What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
2788,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2789,Leonard," If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him."
2790,Eliza,What do you know about he was any bigger ?
2791,Sheldon," Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now."
2792,Eliza,You say Oh ?
2793,Leonard," Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. ."
2794,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2795,Sheldon, You have a back-up hypothesis.
2796,Eliza,"Oh, I have a back-up hypothesis ?"
2797,Leonard, Maybe they just want to be friends.
2798,Eliza,Why the uncertain tone ?
2799,Sheldon," Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more."
2800,Eliza,Can't you be more positive ?
2801,Leonard, Then he and I are on equal ground.
2802,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
2803,Sheldon," Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is."
2804,Eliza,You are sure.
2805,Leonard," Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
2806,Eliza,"Really, if this was 15 ?"
2807,Sheldon," And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy."
2808,Eliza,Please go on.
2809,Leonard," Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down."
2810,Eliza,I see.
2811,Sheldon, True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
2812,Eliza,Do you think its likely that he backs down? ?
2813,Leonard, No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
2814,Eliza,Why do you say your dominance face to face ?
2815,Sheldon," Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
2816,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am going to stand on a coffee table? or not ?
2817,Leonard, Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
2818,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
2819,Penny," Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?"
2820,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2821,Sheldon," Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system."
2822,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
2823,Kurt," What, you're a zebra, right?"
2824,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
2825,Sheldon, Yet another child left behind.
2826,Eliza,Earlier you said your costume .
2827,Kurt," And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?"
2828,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
2829,Leonard," No, I'm a Hobbit."
2830,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2831,Kurt, What's the difference?
2832,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your dominance face to face .
2833,Leonard," Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior."
2834,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2835,Kurt, So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
2836,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
2837,Sheldon," Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash."
2838,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
2839,Kurt," Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here."
2840,Eliza,You want me to go hop off on a quest ?
2841,Leonard, I think we're all talking to Penny here.
2842,Eliza,Do you say you think we're all talking to Penny here for some special reason ?
2843,Sheldon, I'm not. No offence.
2844,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be not ?
2845,Kurt," Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away."
2846,Eliza,You aren't sure ?
2847,Penny," Alright Kurt, be nice."
2848,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2849,Kurt," Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy."
2850,Eliza,Do you enjoy being being nice ?
2851,Penny, Kurt!
2852,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2853,Leonard," Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery."
2854,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we mean each other.
2855,Kurt, Are you calling me a puffy animal?
2856,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't calling you a puffy animal? ?
2857,Penny," Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?"
2858,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2859,Leonard," No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree."
2860,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2861,Sheldon," If he understands that, you're in trouble."
2862,Eliza,Do you wish that he understands that ?
2863,Kurt," So what, I'm unevolved?"
2864,Eliza,What do you think ?
2865,Sheldon, You're in trouble.
2866,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am in trouble ?
2867,Kurt," You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf."
2868,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2869,Penny," Okay, Kurt, please."
2870,Eliza,Please go on.
2871,Leonard," No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
2872,Eliza,Why not ?
2873,Kurt," Okay, now you're starting to make me mad."
2874,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were starting to make you mad ?
2875,Leonard, A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
2876,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2877,Kurt, What?
2878,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2879,Leonard, I think I've made my point.
2880,Eliza,Is it important that your point ?
2881,Kurt," Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head."
2882,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
2883,Sheldon," Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless."
2884,Eliza,Your moral support is absolute ?
2885,Leonard," There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
2886,Eliza,What do you know about he can even spell confrontation ?
2887,Kurt, C - O - N... frontation!
2888,Eliza,But your point .
2889,Penny," Kurt, put him down this instant."
2890,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your moral support is absolute ?
2891,Kurt, He started it.
2892,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2893,Penny," I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down."
2894,Eliza,Is it because you are finishing it that you came to me ?
2895,Kurt, Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.
2896,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be one lucky little leprechaun .
2897,Sheldon, He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.
2898,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my back ?
2899,Penny," Leonard, are you okay."
2900,Eliza,Perhaps I am okay in your fantasies.
2901,Leonard," Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so...."
2902,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
2903,Penny," Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming."
2904,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2905,Sheldon," Happy Halloween.  If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place."
2906,Eliza,"Really, if it's any consolation ?"
2907,Leonard, What's that?
2908,Eliza,Please go on.
2909,Sheldon, Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
2910,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
2911,Leonard, No.
2912,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
2913,Sheldon, Good. There there was really all I had.
2914,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
2915,Leonard, Good night Sheldon.
2916,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2917,Sheldon, Good night Leonard.
2918,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2919,Penny, Hey Leonard.
2920,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2921,Leonard, Hi Penny.
2922,Eliza,Please go on.
2923,Penny," Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay."
2924,Eliza,Do you wish to just wanted to make sure me ?
2925,Leonard, I'm fine.
2926,Eliza,How long have you been fine ?
2927,Penny, I'm so sorry about what happened.
2928,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be so sorry about what happened ?
2929,Leonard, It's not your fault.
2930,Eliza,What about your own fault ?
2931,Penny," Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that."
2932,Eliza,In what way ?
2933,Leonard, So why was he at your party?
2934,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
2935,Penny," Well, I ran into him last week and, he was...  just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to..."
2936,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
2937,Leonard, There there.
2938,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2939,Penny," God, what is wrong with me."
2940,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
2941,Leonard," Nothing, you're perfect."
2942,Eliza,What makes you think I am perfect ?
2943,Penny," Gah, I'm not perfect."
2944,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not perfect ?
2945,Leonard, Yes you are.
2946,Eliza,I understand.
2947,Penny," You really think so, don't you?"
2948,Eliza,"Oh, I really think so ?"
2949,Leonard, Penny?
2950,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2951,Penny, Yeah.
2952,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2953,Leonard, How much have you had to drink tonight?
2954,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
2955,Penny, Just.... a lot.
2956,Eliza,Please go on.
2957,Leonard," Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?"
2958,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am sure that my being drunk ?
2959,Penny," It might. Boy, you're really smart."
2960,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am really smart ?
2961,Leonard," Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius."
2962,Eliza,Is it because you are a frickin' genius that you came to me ?
2963,Penny," Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?"
2964,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
2965,Leonard," Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive."
2966,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
2967,Penny, I should probably go.
2968,Eliza,You say you should probably go ?
2969,Leonard, Probably.
2970,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
2971,Penny, Thank you.
2972,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2973,Leonard," That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire."
2974,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2975,Sheldon, Coming.
2976,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
2977,Howard," Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?"
2978,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
2979,Sheldon, He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
2980,Eliza,Don't you know ?
2981,Howard," He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God."
2982,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
2983,Sheldon, Thank you for the clarification.
2984,Eliza,"Oh, I for the clarification ?"
2985,Howard, I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
2986,Eliza,How long have you been supposed to give him a ride home ?
2987,Sheldon, Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.
2988,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sure he'll be fine ?
2989,Butterfly Girl," Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!"
2990,Eliza,Why do you say your God ?
2991,Howard," Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter."
2992,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your God .
2993,Howard's phone," Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?"
2994,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
2995,Howard, No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
2996,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
2997,Howard's phone," Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader."
2998,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
2999,Howard, No.
3000,Eliza,Why not ?
3001,Leonard," Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh."
3002,Eliza,Please go on.
3003,Howard's phone, Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .
3004,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3005,Raj," Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist."
3006,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3007,Leonard, So? We'll start now.
3008,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3009,Sheldon," Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
3010,Eliza,Do you think its likely that those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time ?
3011,Raj," We can split it two, two and two."
3012,Eliza,Please go on.
3013,Howard, If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
3014,Eliza,Do you wish that we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time ?
3015,Sheldon," Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
3016,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
3017,Leonard," Hey Penny, come on in."
3018,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3019,Penny, Hey guys.
3020,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3021,Howard," See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck."
3022,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3023,Penny," No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while."
3024,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3025,Leonard, Sure. What's going on.
3026,Eliza,Please go on.
3027,Penny," Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she's like “Hey, how's California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me."
3028,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
3029,Penny," Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
3030,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3031,Howard," Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
3032,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
3033,Penny, He really needs to dial it down.
3034,Eliza,Earlier you said your bathroom sink .
3035,Leonard," So, if you don't like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?"
3036,Eliza,What do you know about I don't like this Christie ?
3037,Penny," Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family."
3038,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your family ?
3039,Sheldon," You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
3040,Eliza,Is it important that your earlier outburst ?
3041,Leonard," Oh, I don't think she's a whore."
3042,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to think she's a whore ?
3043,Penny," No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at... where's Howard?"
3044,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3045,Howard," Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town."
3046,Eliza,You seem to need to understand me.
3047,Sheldon, Oh good grief.
3048,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your earlier outburst ?
3049,Penny," Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment."
3050,Eliza,Your apartment ?
3051,Leonard," Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back."
3052,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your apartment .
3053,Sheldon," One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
3054,Eliza,But your brother .
3055,Leonard, Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
3056,Eliza,"Really, if we cut Raj in half ?"
3057,Raj," Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from."
3058,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3059,Penny," Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play."
3060,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I guys need a fourth ?
3061,Leonard, Great idea.
3062,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3063,Sheldon," Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that."
3064,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
3065,Penny, Why?
3066,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3067,Sheldon," Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
3068,Eliza,Please go on.
3069,Penny," Oh, what, what, what?"
3070,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
3071,Sheldon," This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
3072,Eliza,Possibly they are myriad weapons .
3073,Penny," Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?"
3074,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3075,Sheldon, Mine.
3076,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3077,Penny," Okay, I got this, lock and load boys."
3078,Eliza,Do you say Okay for some special reason ?
3079,Leonard, It's the only way we can play teams.
3080,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3081,Sheldon," Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh...."
3082,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
3083,Penny," Ha-ha, there goes your head again."
3084,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's head again ?
3085,Sheldon," Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
3086,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3087,Sheldon," Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me."
3088,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3089,Penny," Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"
3090,Eliza,Please go on.
3091,Leonard," Penny, you are on fire."
3092,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were on fire ?
3093,Penny," Yeah, so is Sheldon."
3094,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3095,Sheldon," Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."
3096,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
3097,Penny," Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something."
3098,Eliza,"Oh, I forgot something ?"
3099,Sheldon, What?
3100,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3101,Penny," This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it's raining you!"
3102,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3103,Sheldon," You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support."
3104,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3105,Penny," Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?"
3106,Eliza,Please go on.
3107,Leonard," Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner."
3108,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3109,Penny," Well, it's been fun."
3110,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3111,Leonard," You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
3112,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3113,Penny, Or we could just have a life.
3114,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3115,Leonard, I guess for you that's an option.
3116,Eliza,Do you guess for anyone else ?
3117,Penny," Good night, Leonard."
3118,Eliza,Please go on.
3119,Leonard, Good night.
3120,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3121,Penny," As usual, nice talking to you Raj"
3122,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3123,Raj, What do you suppose she meant by that?
3124,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
3125,Leonard," She's an enigma, Raj."
3126,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3127,Sheldon," And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab..."
3128,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3129,Leonard," She's gone, Sheldon."
3130,Eliza,Please go on.
3131,Sheldon, Well she could have said goodbye.
3132,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3133,Penny," Okay, I have a problem."
3134,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3135,Sheldon," It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it."
3136,Eliza,"Oh, I deserve it ?"
3137,Leonard, What's wrong?
3138,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3139,Penny," Um, well, Howard and Christie are... kind of... hooking up in my bedroom."
3140,Eliza,Why do you say your bedroom ?
3141,Leonard, Are you sure?
3142,Eliza,What do you think ?
3143,Penny," Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
3144,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
3145,Leonard," No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics."
3146,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3147,Penny," Uh, the couch is good."
3148,Eliza,Earlier you said your bedroom .
3149,Sheldon," Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
3150,Eliza,But your bed .
3151,Leonard," Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
3152,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3153,Sheldon, Where do I begin?
3154,Eliza,You say Where do you begin? ?
3155,Leonard," It's up to you, crazy person's choice."
3156,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3157,Sheldon," Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I'd ask you to leave."
3158,Eliza,Do you wish that you could afford the rent I'd ask I to leave ?
3159,Leonard," Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?"
3160,Eliza,"Really, my friendship means a lot to you as well ?"
3161,Sheldon," Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
3162,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3163,Leonard, So?
3164,Eliza,Please go on.
3165,Sheldon," So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon."
3166,Eliza,What do you know about there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here ?
3167,Leonard," I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
3168,Eliza,"Really, if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism? ?"
3169,Sheldon, No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
3170,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3171,Leonard," Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay."
3172,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep ?
3173,Penny, Hu.. what?
3174,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3175,Sheldon," He's engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it."
3176,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3177,Leonard, I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
3178,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3179,Penny, How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
3180,Eliza,Is it important that your bodily functions? ?
3181,Sheldon, I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
3182,Eliza,Do you say you suggest no liquids after 11pm for some special reason ?
3183,Leonard, Here you go.
3184,Eliza,"Oh, I go ?"
3185,Penny, Thanks Leonard.
3186,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your bodily functions? ?
3187,Sheldon," Hmmph, wrong."
3188,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3189,Penny, I'm listening.
3190,Eliza,Do you enjoy being listening ?
3191,Sheldon, Your head goes on the other end.
3192,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my head goes on the other end ?
3193,Penny, Why?
3194,Eliza,Please go on.
3195,Sheldon," It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
3196,Eliza,When ?
3197,Penny, I'll risk it.
3198,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3199,Sheldon, Hm!
3200,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3201,Penny, Anything else I should know.
3202,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3203,Sheldon, Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
3204,Eliza,Do you wish that I use your toothbrush I'll jump out that window ?
3205,Leonard, Sorry about that.
3206,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
3207,Penny, That's okay.
3208,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3209,Leonard," FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light."
3210,Eliza,Please go on.
3211,Penny, Got it.
3212,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3213,Leonard," Well, sleep tight."
3214,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3215,Penny, Thanks.
3216,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3217,Leonard," Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally... sleep tight."
3218,Eliza,Please go on.
3219,Leonard, What are you doing?
3220,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
3221,Leonard, Penny's still sleeping.
3222,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3223,Leonard," I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?"
3224,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we know each other.
3225,Sheldon, Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
3226,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
3227,Penny," Uh, what time is it?"
3228,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
3229,Penny, I slept all day?
3230,Eliza,You say you slept all day? ?
3231,Penny, What the hell is your problem?
3232,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
3233,Sheldon," Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
3234,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3235,Howard," Ola, nerd-migos."
3236,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3237,Penny, Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
3238,Eliza,Your robe? ?
3239,Howard," Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned."
3240,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
3241,Penny," That's okay, keep it. Where's Christie."
3242,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your robe? .
3243,Howard," In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won't."
3244,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3245,Penny, Y-you used my loofah?
3246,Eliza,Why do you say your loofah? ?
3247,Howard, More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
3248,Eliza,What about your own loofah ?
3249,Penny, You can keep that too.
3250,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3251,Howard," Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
3252,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's stuffed bear collection ?
3253,Christie, Howard?
3254,Eliza,Earlier you said your loofah? .
3255,Howard, In here my lady.
3256,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3257,Christie," Mmmm, there's my little engine that could."
3258,Eliza,Is it important that your little engine that could ?
3259,Howard, chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
3260,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your little engine that could ?
3261,Sheldon, Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
3262,Eliza,But your lady .
3263,Christie," Hi, Christie."
3264,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3265,Leonard, Leonard.
3266,Eliza,Please go on.
3267,Sheldon, I'm Sheldon.
3268,Eliza,Is it because you are Sheldon that you came to me ?
3269,Christie," Right, you're Howard's entourage."
3270,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be Howard's entourage .
3271,Penny," Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?"
3272,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
3273,Christie," Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills."
3274,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3275,Penny," Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's... a little crowded."
3276,Eliza,Why not ?
3277,Leonard," Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us."
3278,Eliza,What makes you think I am always welcome to stay with us ?
3279,Sheldon," Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B."
3280,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3281,Howard," Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christie stay with me."
3282,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
3283,Leonard, For one thing you live with your mother.
3284,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3285,Howard," I do not, my mother lives with me."
3286,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
3287,Sheldon," Well then, it's all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother."
3288,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
3289,Leonard, Sheldon you just can't dictate...
3290,Eliza,"Oh, I just can't dictate ?"
3291,Sheldon," No more talking, everybody go."
3292,Eliza,Someone special perhaps ?
3293,Howard," So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?"
3294,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
3295,Christie," What is that, like a Mexican deli?"
3296,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
3297,Howard," I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz."
3298,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
3299,Christie," Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!"
3300,Eliza,Your first Jew! ?
3301,Sheldon, I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.
3302,Eliza,Do you say you imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers for some special reason ?
3303,Christie," But you're still taking me shopping, right?"
3304,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am still taking you shopping ?
3305,Howard, Anything you want.
3306,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3307,Christie," Okay, I'll go pack my stuff."
3308,Eliza,Why do you say your stuff ?
3309,Howard, When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.
3310,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
3311,Leonard," Howard, can't you see she's using you?"
3312,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3313,Howard," Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!"
3314,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3315,Penny," Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things."
3316,Eliza,You say Look ?
3317,Howard, Really?
3318,Eliza,Earlier you said your first Jew! .
3319,Penny, Yeah.
3320,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your mother lives with you .
3321,Howard," Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash."
3322,Eliza,What do you know about you'll excuse you ?
3323,Sheldon," I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
3324,Eliza,How long have you been sorry ?
3325,Leonard, We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
3326,Eliza,But your stuff .
3327,Sheldon," Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
3328,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3329,Leonard, I see a problem.
3330,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3331,Sheldon, Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
3332,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3333,Leonard," So, we'll just order three entrees."
3334,Eliza,Please go on.
3335,Sheldon," Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling."
3336,Eliza,What do you think ?
3337,Raj, We could cut it into thirds.
3338,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3339,Sheldon," Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich."
3340,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3341,Waiter," Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?"
3342,Eliza,"Really, my annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin? ?"
3343,Sheldon," He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that's punishable by death."
3344,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3345,Waiter, I come from Sacramento.
3346,Eliza,Do you say you come from Sacramento for some special reason ?
3347,Leonard," Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
3348,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3349,Waiter, No substitutions.
3350,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3351,Leonard," This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction."
3352,Eliza,Please go on.
3353,Waiter," Okay, no reductions."
3354,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
3355,Leonard," Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four."
3356,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3357,Raj, That works.
3358,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3359,Sheldon," No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree."
3360,Eliza,"Really, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree ?"
3361,Waiter, No eliminations.
3362,Eliza,Why not ?
3363,Leonard," If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home."
3364,Eliza,Do you think its likely that we have extra ?
3365,Sheldon," And divide it how, I'm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
3366,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
3367,Leonard," Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
3368,Eliza,Do you wish that I had let you invite Penny then I would have had my fourth ?
3369,Sheldon," Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls."
3370,Eliza,"Oh, I seen Penny eat Chinese food ?"
3371,Leonard, We don't order egg rolls.
3372,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3373,Sheldon," Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here."
3374,Eliza,What do you know about she was here ?
3375,Raj," Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here."
3376,Eliza,Did you think they might not be there children starving in India ?
3377,Leonard," Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food."
3378,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
3379,Sheldon, No.
3380,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3381,Raj, Uurgh.
3382,Eliza,Please go on.
3383,Waiter," You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know."
3384,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were nice boys ?
3385,Sheldon, I'll know.
3386,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3387,Raj, How about soup?
3388,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
3389,Leonard," Yeah, we can always divide soup."
3390,Eliza,What incident are you thinking of ?
3391,Sheldon, What about the won-tons?
3392,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
3393,Penny," Oh, hey guys, what's up?"
3394,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3395,Sheldon, It's Halo night.
3396,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3397,Penny, Yeah. Okay. So?
3398,Eliza,Please go on.
3399,Leonard," Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,"
3400,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my friend Christie ?
3401,Penny, She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
3402,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3403,Leonard," Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
3404,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3405,Sheldon," Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honour this is."
3406,Eliza,"Really, if I would be the fourth member of our Halo team ?"
3407,Penny," Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend."
3408,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be going out dancing with a girlfriend ?
3409,Sheldon," You can't go out, it's Halo night."
3410,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3411,Penny," Well, for Penny it's dancing night."
3412,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friend ?
3413,Sheldon, You go dancing every Wednesday.
3414,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3415,Penny, No.
3416,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3417,Sheldon,  Then it's not dancing night.
3418,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3419,Penny," Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?"
3420,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
3421,Sheldon," Tonight is Halo night, it's like talking to a wall."
3422,Eliza,How ?
3423,Penny," Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem."
3424,Eliza,"Oh, I and you are about to have a problem ?"
3425,Leonard," Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
3426,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3427,Sheldon," Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational."
3428,Eliza,You are sure.
3429,Penny," Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck."
3430,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3431,Leonard, Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
3432,Eliza,Do you think its likely that we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend ?
3433,Sheldon," Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them."
3434,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not three of us and two of them ?
3435,Leonard, So?
3436,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3437,Sheldon," It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
3438,Eliza,Do you wish to assure me ?
3439,Leonard," Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy."
3440,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be driving you crazy .
3441,Sheldon," Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
3442,Eliza,What about your own anger's not with you ?
3443,Leonard," No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you."
3444,Eliza,Is it important that your anger's with I ?
3445,Raj, What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
3446,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your anger's with I .
3447,Leonard, Who are you calling?
3448,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am calling? or not ?
3449,Sheldon, The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
3450,Eliza,Please go on.
3451,Howard,  Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
3452,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3453,Christie, And this is Christie Van Der Bell.
3454,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3455,Howard, We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex.
3456,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
3457,Christie, You're not going to put that on your message are you?
3458,Eliza,What makes you think I am not going to put that on my message are you? ?
3459,Howard," No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it."
3460,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
3461,Leonard," Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
3462,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo ?
3463,Sheldon," No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."
3464,Eliza,Why not ?
3465,Leonard," You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact."
3466,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were right ?
3467,Sheldon, My point.
3468,Eliza,Your point ?
3469,Christie," I'm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while."
3470,Eliza,Do you enjoy being just saying ?
3471,Howard's Mother," Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?"
3472,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
3473,Howard," Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground."
3474,Eliza,Is it because you are sure there's a middle ground that you came to me ?
3475,Christie and Howard's Mother together, Shut up Howard.
3476,Eliza,Earlier you said your point .
3477,Howard," You girl's talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin."
3478,Eliza,Why do you say your scooter out for a little spin ?
3479,Christie," Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house."
3480,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't happy ?
3481,Howard's Mother, Why don't you stop butting in where you don't belong.
3482,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
3483,Howard, What are you guys doing here?
3484,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
3485,Sheldon, It's Halo night.
3486,Eliza,But your scooter out for a little spin .
3487,Howard's Mother," He's not a man, he's a putz, and don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger."
3488,Eliza,You like to think I take that tone with you -- don't you ?
3489,Christie, What did you call me?
3490,Eliza,What do you think ?
3491,Howard's Mother," You heard me, and I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will."
3492,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be around .
3493,Howard's Mother," That's right, go back to Babylon, you whore."
3494,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3495,Howard," So, Halo night, huh?"
3496,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3497,Raj, I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
3498,Eliza,You say you thought she was the whore of Omaha? ?
3499,Sheldon, Shhh!
3500,Eliza,Please go on.
3501,Howard," Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle."
3502,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3503,Sheldon," I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking."
3504,Eliza,How long have you been cloaking ?
3505,Leonard," Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
3506,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3507,Raj, I can't see him.
3508,Eliza,Perhaps you could see him now.
3509,Sheldon," That's why the call it cloaking, dead man."
3510,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
3511,Leonard, Well then start throwing grenades.
3512,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3513,Raj, I'm all out.
3514,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be all out ?
3515,Penny," Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you."
3516,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3517,Leonard," That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
3518,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friends and you got tired of dancing ?
3519,Sheldon, We said no tanks.
3520,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3521,Raj, There are no rules in hell!
3522,Eliza,What if they were not no rules in hell! ?
3523,Howard," Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!"
3524,Eliza,What does wanting a medpack! have to do with this discussion ?
3525,Penny, Told yah! .
3526,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3527,Leonard," There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher."
3528,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's rocket launcher ?
3529,Raj," All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo."
3530,Eliza,Do you enjoy being all out of ammo ?
3531,Sheldon, And now you're out of life. Why did you hit pause?
3532,Eliza,What makes you think I am out of life ?
3533,Leonard, I thought I heard something.
3534,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3535,Raj, What?
3536,Eliza,Please go on.
3537,Leonard," No, never mind, alright, go."
3538,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3539,Sheldon," Damn you, walletnook.com."
3540,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3541,Leonard, Problem?
3542,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3543,Sheldon," The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it's a nightmare."
3544,Eliza,"Oh, I the removable ID takes up one slot ?"
3545,Leonard," Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"
3546,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3547,Sheldon, It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.
3548,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were five now ?
3549,Leonard, Why?
3550,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3551,Sheldon, It says keep this on your person at all times.  It's right here under Batman's signature.
3552,Eliza,"Really, my person at all times ?"
3553,Raj, And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
3554,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3555,Howard, Guess whose parents just got broadband.
3556,Eliza,Please go on.
3557,Raj," May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali."
3558,Eliza,Do you say May you present for some special reason ?
3559,Leonard, Hi.
3560,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3561,Dr Koothrappali, Lift up the camera. I'm looking at his crotch.
3562,Eliza,Is it because you are looking at his crotch that you came to me ?
3563,Raj, Sorry papa.
3564,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
3565,Dr Koothrappali," Oh, there's much better. Hi."
3566,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3567,Leonard, Hi!
3568,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3569,Raj, And over here is Sheldon.
3570,Eliza,Please go on.
3571,Sheldon, Hi.
3572,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3573,Raj, He lives with Leonard.
3574,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3575,Mrs Koothrappali," Oh, that's nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer."
3576,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3577,Raj," No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer."
3578,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
3579,Mrs Koothrappali," Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby."
3580,Eliza,Please go on.
3581,Leonard," Yeah, we're not like Haroun and Tanweer!"
3582,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3583,Dr Koothrappali, So are you boys academics like our son?
3584,Eliza,In what way ?
3585,Together, Yes.
3586,Eliza,I see.
3587,Dr Koothrappali, And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?
3588,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my limited earning potential? ?
3589,Together, Not at all.
3590,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3591,Raj," Papa, please don't start."
3592,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3593,Dr Koothrappali," God, it's just a question, he's so sensitive."
3594,Eliza,Please go on.
3595,Raj," Okay, that's my life, that's my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
3596,Eliza,Is it important that your friends ?
3597,Together, Bye!
3598,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your friends .
3599,Dr Koothrappali," Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends."
3600,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
3601,Raj, What is it papa.
3602,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
3603,Dr Koothrappali, Friends.
3604,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3605,Howard," Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless."
3606,Eliza,What about your own clothes on seem a little pointless ?
3607,Mrs Koothrappali," Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?"
3608,Eliza,Did you think I would forget Lalita Gupta? ?
3609,Raj, The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
3610,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3611,Mrs Koothrappali," Yes. Well, now she's a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information."
3612,Eliza,I understand.
3613,Raj, Why did you do that?
3614,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
3615,Dr Koothrappali, You're 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.
3616,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am 26 years old Rajesh ?
3617,Raj," But Papa, I'm not supposed..."
3618,Eliza,How long have you been not supposed ?
3619,Mrs Koothrappali, Lalita's parents approve the match.
3620,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3621,Dr Koothrappali," If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season."
3622,Eliza,Do you wish that I decide on a spring wedding ?
3623,Raj, Spring wedding?
3624,Eliza,Please go on.
3625,Mrs Koothrappali," It's up to you dear, we don't want to meddle."
3626,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3627,Raj," If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
3628,Eliza,What do you know about I don't want to meddle ?
3629,Sheldon," If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives."
3630,Eliza,"Really, if you may ?"
3631,Raj, Why are you telling me about my own culture?
3632,Eliza,Your own culture? ?
3633,Sheldon, You seemed confused.
3634,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3635,Raj," Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can't go through..."
3636,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
3637,Mrs Koothrappali," Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it's Doogie time! Bye bye."
3638,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
3639,Dr Koothrappali, Bye bye.
3640,Eliza,Earlier you said your own culture? .
3641,Raj, I don't believe it.
3642,Eliza,Don't you really believe it ?
3643,Howard," Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like, twenty years."
3644,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3645,Leonard," Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India."
3646,Eliza,You say Actually ?
3647,Sheldon, It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession.
3648,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3649,Leonard, I bet you're right.
3650,Eliza,You seem to need to bet me.
3651,Howard, I bet they love Scrubs.
3652,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3653,Sheldon, What's not to love?
3654,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3655,Raj," Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?"
3656,Eliza,Why do you say your parents are trying to marry you off to a total stranger ?
3657,Sheldon, I suggest you go through with it.
3658,Eliza,Do you suggest anyone else ?
3659,Raj, What?
3660,Eliza,But your parents are trying to marry you off to a total stranger .
3661,Sheldon," Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
3662,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3663,Howard, It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
3664,Eliza,Please go on.
3665,Leonard," I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show."
3666,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be not a big fan of musicals ?
3667,Howard," Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally."
3668,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3669,Sheldon," Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
3670,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3671,Howard, Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.
3672,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3673,Raj," Okay, I know what I'm going to do."
3674,Eliza,Do you enjoy being going to do ?
3675,Leonard, What?
3676,Eliza,Please go on.
3677,Raj, Find new friends.
3678,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3679,Howard, So who wants to rent Fiddler?
3680,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3681,Sheldon," No need, we have the special edition."
3682,Eliza,Why not ?
3683,Leonard," Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer."
3684,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
3685,Sheldon," This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I'm sorry too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. Well I'll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me, and I'd really like you to stop."
3686,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
3687,Raj," Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed."
3688,Eliza,Is it because you are rightly and truly screwed that you came to me ?
3689,Leonard," Hey, I thought you were finding new friends."
3690,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we thought each other.
3691,Raj," I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this."
3692,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3693,Lalita," Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I'm calling you, and, ah... call me back. Bye."
3694,Eliza,Who else in your family my phone number to give to you ?
3695,Raj, Can you believe how pushy she is?
3696,Eliza,You want me to be able to believe what pushy she is? .
3697,Leonard, So don't call her.
3698,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your mother my phone number to give to you ?
3699,Raj," If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents."
3700,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you don't call her ?
3701,Leonard, So call her.
3702,Eliza,Please go on.
3703,Raj," How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women."
3704,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
3705,Leonard," I'm done, anybody else?"
3706,Eliza,How long have you been done ?
3707,Howard, Give me the phone.
3708,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3709,Raj, Why?
3710,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3711,Howard, Just give it to me.
3712,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3713,Raj, What are you doing?
3714,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
3715,Howard," Don't worry, you'll thank me.  Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali.  Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe.  You may now thank me."
3716,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
3717,Raj," For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?"
3718,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
3719,Howard," Fine, next time make your own date."
3720,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's own date ?
3721,Raj, I didn't want to make this one.
3722,Eliza,Do you say you didn't want to make this one for some special reason ?
3723,Leonard," Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl."
3724,Eliza,Please go on.
3725,Raj," Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence."
3726,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3727,Howard, Worked for my parents.
3728,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3729,Penny, Hi guys.
3730,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your parents .
3731,Leonard," Oh, hey."
3732,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3733,Penny, I need some guinea pigs.
3734,Eliza,What would it mean to you if you got some guinea pigs ?
3735,Sheldon," Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours."
3736,Eliza,Do you wish that my research is going to have human applications may you suggest white mice instead ?
3737,Penny," I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you."
3738,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be going to get the hang of talking to I ?
3739,Leonard, His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?
3740,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3741,Penny," Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks."
3742,Eliza,Why do you want to practice making drinks ?
3743,Leonard," Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
3744,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3745,Sheldon," With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example."
3746,Eliza,Please go on.
3747,Penny," So Leonard, how about it?"
3748,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
3749,Leonard," Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn't drink, so...  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking."
3750,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
3751,Penny," Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise."
3752,Eliza,"Oh, I go ?"
3753,Leonard, Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
3754,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3755,Penny," Okay, Raj, what'll it be?"
3756,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3757,Leonard, Whatever you recommend.
3758,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3759,Penny," Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?"
3760,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
3761,Sheldon, I'll have a diet coke.
3762,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3763,Penny," Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks."
3764,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be able to please order a cocktail yourself.
3765,Sheldon, Fine. I'll have a virgin cuba libre.
3766,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3767,Penny," That's, um, rum and coke without the rum."
3768,Eliza,Please go on.
3769,Sheldon," Yes,"
3770,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
3771,Penny, So coke.
3772,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3773,Sheldon, Yes. And would you make it diet?
3774,Eliza,You are sure.
3775,Penny, There's a can in the fridge.
3776,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3777,Sheldon, A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
3778,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3779,Penny, Then swim to Cuba.
3780,Eliza,Please go on.
3781,Sheldon, Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
3782,Eliza,Possibly they are supposed to have people skills .
3783,Penny," Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?"
3784,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3785,Howard, I'd like to try a slippery nipple.
3786,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3787,Penny," Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?"
3788,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were cut off ?
3789,Raj," Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree batchelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi."
3790,Eliza,Is it important that your life go ?
3791,Penny, A... are you talking to me?
3792,Eliza,Perhaps I am talking to me? in your fantasies.
3793,Raj," Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course."
3794,Eliza,What does that dream suggest to you ?
3795,Leonard, It's amazing.
3796,Eliza,Earlier you said your life go .
3797,Raj," Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam."
3798,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
3799,Penny," Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking."
3800,Eliza,You say Okay ?
3801,Raj, And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
3802,Eliza,Your parents that you are not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta ?
3803,Penny," Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
3804,Eliza,"Oh, I just meet this girl and ?"
3805,Raj," Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women."
3806,Eliza,What makes you think I been listening to you ?
3807,Leonard, Um... Raj.
3808,Eliza,But your parents that you are not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta .
3809,Howard," No, no, let's see how long it takes him."
3810,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3811,Penny," Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but... you've been talking to me."
3812,Eliza,"Really, I can't talk to women but you ?"
3813,Sheldon, And now we'll never know.
3814,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3815,Raj," You're right. I... I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?"
3816,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be right .
3817,Penny, I'm fine.
3818,Eliza,Do you enjoy being fine ?
3819,Raj," Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle."
3820,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3821,Penny," Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it."
3822,Eliza,What do you know about I are going to drink on this date just promise you I won't overdo it ?
3823,Raj, Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
3824,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3825,Penny," Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?"
3826,Eliza,Why do you say your restaurant what you are tending the bar so you can keep an eye on you? ?
3827,Raj, Okay.
3828,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your restaurant what you are tending the bar so you can keep an eye on you? ?
3829,Leonard," Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
3830,Eliza,Please go on.
3831,Howard, Worked for my parents.
3832,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3833,Raj, I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
3834,Eliza,Is it because you are sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta that you came to me ?
3835,Lalita," Well, you are."
3836,Eliza,What makes you think I am ?
3837,Raj," Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it."
3838,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3839,Lalita," No, it's okay."
3840,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3841,Raj," You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?"
3842,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3843,Lalita," Yes, I do."
3844,Eliza,I see.
3845,Raj, Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
3846,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3847,Lalita," Well, I've been trying."
3848,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your parents .
3849,Raj," So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning."
3850,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am still winning ?
3851,Lalita, Yay me!
3852,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3853,Leonard, You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?
3854,Eliza,"Oh, I have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious? ?"
3855,Penny, Drinks do not work that way.
3856,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3857,Howard," I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail."
3858,Eliza,Your mom ?
3859,Sheldon, Sorry I'm late.
3860,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
3861,Leonard, What happened?
3862,Eliza,What do you think ?
3863,Sheldon," Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
3864,Eliza,Do you say Nothing for some special reason ?
3865,Penny, Okay.
3866,Eliza,Earlier you said your mom set you up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail .
3867,Sheldon," In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
3868,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3869,Penny," Oh, I'll wedge it right in there."
3870,Eliza,Please go on.
3871,Sheldon," So, how's Koothrappali d.... oh my Lord."
3872,Eliza,Is it important that your Lord ?
3873,Leonard, What?
3874,Eliza,But your Lord .
3875,Sheldon, That's Princess Punchali.
3876,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3877,Leonard, I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
3878,Eliza,How long have you been pretty sure her name's Lalita ?
3879,Sheldon," No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess."
3880,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
3881,Howard," Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card."
3882,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3883,Sheldon, It's a children's story.
3884,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3885,Howard," Oh, no it isn't."
3886,Eliza,Why not ?
3887,Sheldon," When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly."
3888,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were a little boy and got sick .
3889,Penny, I know the reason.
3890,Eliza,You say you know the reason ?
3891,Leonard," We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
3892,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
3893,Sheldon, That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
3894,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
3895,Howard," Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but..."
3896,Eliza,"Really, if I have a kid ?"
3897,Raj," Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!"
3898,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3899,Sheldon," Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
3900,Eliza,Your nature to climb ?
3901,Lalita, I'm sorry?
3902,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry? ?
3903,Sheldon, You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
3904,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali ?
3905,Lalita," Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?"
3906,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
3907,Sheldon, A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
3908,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your nature to climb ?
3909,Lalita," Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?"
3910,Eliza,Please go on.
3911,Sheldon, You Indian.
3912,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
3913,Lalita, Oh.
3914,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3915,Sheldon, The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
3916,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
3917,Lalita, Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
3918,Eliza,Do you wish to imagine me ?
3919,Sheldon, I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
3920,Eliza,Why do you say your hands as often as you can ?
3921,Lalita," Really, so do I."
3922,Eliza,Do you say Really for some special reason ?
3923,Raj," But you're a dentist, he's nuts."
3924,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be a dentist .
3925,Lalita," Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like."
3926,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
3927,Sheldon," It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips."
3928,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your hands as often as you can .
3929,Lalita, Oh my.
3930,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3931,Raj, Back off Sheldon.
3932,Eliza,Earlier you said your .
3933,Sheldon, What?
3934,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3935,Raj, If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
3936,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I do not stop hitting on your lady I will feel the full extent of your wrath ?
3937,Sheldon, I'm not hitting on her.
3938,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not hitting on her ?
3939,Lalita, And I am not your lady.
3940,Eliza,Is it because you are not my lady that you came to me ?
3941,Howard, And you have no wrath.
3942,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
3943,Raj, You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
3944,Eliza,Is it important that your lady ?
3945,Lalita," Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you."
3946,Eliza,Your case ?
3947,Sheldon, Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
3948,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your case ?
3949,Raj," Oh, screw Princess Punchali."
3950,Eliza,But your lady .
3951,Lalita," Hey, you can't talk to me like that."
3952,Eliza,Do you wish to believe I can't talk to you ?
3953,Raj, But you're not Princess Punchali.
3954,Eliza,What makes you think I am not Princess Punchali ?
3955,Sheldon," Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
3956,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
3957,Lalita," Sheldon, are you hungry?"
3958,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am hungry? ?
3959,Sheldon, I could eat.
3960,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
3961,Lalita, Let's go.
3962,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3963,Raj, What just happened?
3964,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
3965,Leonard, Beats the hell out of me.
3966,Eliza,Please go on.
3967,Howard," I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks."
3968,Eliza,"Oh, I what just happened ?"
3969,Mrs Koothrappali, What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?
3970,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
3971,Dr Koothrappali," I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him."
3972,Eliza,You say you play golf with her father ?
3973,Raj," Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa."
3974,Eliza,You don't seem quite certain.
3975,Dr Koothrappali," Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man."
3976,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am a funny man? This is not funny ?
3977,Leonard," Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault."
3978,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
3979,Dr Koothrappali, This is a family matter Sheldon.
3980,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
3981,Leonard," No, I'm Leonard."
3982,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
3983,Dr Koothrappali," Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us."
3984,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
3985,Raj," But he's right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything!"
3986,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were the one who ruined everything! ?
3987,Mrs Koothrappali, Who is it? We can't see.
3988,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
3989,Dr Koothrappali," Turn us, turn us."
3990,Eliza,Please go on.
3991,Raj," Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren."
3992,Eliza,Why do you say your parents why they won't have any grandchildren ?
3993,Sheldon," How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?"
3994,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
3995,Raj, This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
3996,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
3997,Mrs Koothrappali," You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you Rajesh."
3998,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be wearing the boxers that we sent I .
3999,Raj, Yes Mommy.
4000,Eliza,I understand.
4001,Mrs Koothrappali, Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
4002,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
4003,Raj," Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did."
4004,Eliza,Is it important that your testicles? Sheldon ?
4005,Sheldon, What did I do?
4006,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4007,Leonard, You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.
4008,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4009,Sheldon," Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry."
4010,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
4011,Raj, Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?
4012,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4013,Leonard," Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten."
4014,Eliza,But your testicles? Sheldon .
4015,Sheldon, And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.
4016,Eliza,Do you wish that I hadn't been drunk and boring ?
4017,Dr Koothrappali, Drunk?
4018,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your parents why they won't have any grandchildren .
4019,Sheldon," And boring, her words."
4020,Eliza,Earlier you said your sperm count .
4021,Dr Koothrappali," I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic."
4022,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4023,Raj, I'm not an alcoholic.
4024,Eliza,How long have you been not an alcoholic ?
4025,Dr Koothrappali, Then why were you drunk?
4026,Eliza,What suggests that I was drunk? ?
4027,Raj," It was just this one time, Papa, I swear."
4028,Eliza,Do you say It was just this one time for some special reason ?
4029,Dr Koothrappali, Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?
4030,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4031,Mrs Koothrappali, Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.
4032,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4033,Dr Koothrappali," Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private."
4034,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4035,Raj," But Papa, please...."
4036,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4037,Dr Koothrappali," Now, Rajesh."
4038,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4039,Raj, I have to go.
4040,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4041,Dr Koothrappali, Now listen to me....
4042,Eliza,Please go on.
4043,Raj, Please wait until I get into the hall.
4044,Eliza,You say Please wait until you get into the hall ?
4045,Sheldon," Okay, well, good night."
4046,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4047,Leonard, Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
4048,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4049,Sheldon," We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home."
4050,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4051,Leonard, So you're not going to see her again?
4052,Eliza,What makes you think I am not going to see her again? ?
4053,Sheldon, Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.
4054,Eliza,What do you think ?
4055,Leonard, I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.
4056,Eliza,Do you say you wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren for some special reason ?
4057,Leonard," I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?"
4058,Eliza,Why don't you believe it ?
4059,Penny," Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty."
4060,Eliza,Why the uncertain tone ?
4061,Leonard, You didn't?
4062,Eliza,"Oh, I didn't? ?"
4063,Penny," Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
4064,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4065,Leonard," Okay, the X10s are online."
4066,Eliza,Did you think they might not be online ?
4067,Howard," Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp. ."
4068,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP ?
4069,Sheldon," Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps."
4070,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4071,Howard, Are we ready on the stereo?
4072,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not we ready on the stereo? ?
4073,Raj, Go for stereo.
4074,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4075,Penny, Hey guys.
4076,Eliza,Please go on.
4077,All, Hello.
4078,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
4079,Penny, It's a little loud.
4080,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4081,Howard," No problem, turning it down.  San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax  et voila."
4082,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4083,Penny," Okay, thanks."
4084,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4085,Leonard," Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
4086,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4087,Penny," Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop."
4088,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4089,Sheldon," No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet."
4090,Eliza,Why not ?
4091,Penny," Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they're really cheap."
4092,Eliza,"Oh, I can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack ?"
4093,Leonard," No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access."
4094,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4095,Howard, Public access enabled.
4096,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4097,Penny," Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you."
4098,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4099,Leonard," No, hang on, hang on.  See!"
4100,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4101,Penny, No.
4102,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4103,Sheldon," Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off."
4104,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
4105,Penny," Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why?"
4106,Eliza,Please go on.
4107,All together, Because we can.
4108,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
4109,Sheldon, They found the remote controlled cars.
4110,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4111,Penny," Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them."
4112,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4113,Leonard," Wireless webcams, wave hello."
4114,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
4115,Howard," The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv."
4116,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4117,Sheldon, You may want to put on slacks.
4118,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4119,Penny," What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone."
4120,Eliza,Why not ?
4121,Leonard, Who's running the red Corvette?
4122,Eliza,Please go on.
4123,Howard, That would be me.
4124,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4125,Sheldon," You know, in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars, we're going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted."
4126,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4127,Raj, I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
4128,Eliza,Your brain in an android body ?
4129,Howard, I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother.
4130,Eliza,What do you know about you are a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish ?
4131,Raj, I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
4132,Eliza,You seem to need to suppose me.
4133,Sheldon, Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays.
4134,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your brain in an android body ?
4135,Leonard," Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?"
4136,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4137,Sheldon," Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out."
4138,Eliza,"Really, always ?"
4139,Leonard, It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
4140,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4141,Sheldon, I know. I read it before I threw it out.
4142,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4143,Leonard," Okay... if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
4144,Eliza,"Really, if you may drill down to the bedrock of your question ?"
4145,Sheldon," Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn't recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be."
4146,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you was there ?
4147,Howard," I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary."
4148,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know ?
4149,Leonard, Forget the parties.
4150,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4151,Howard, Forget the parties? What a nerd.
4152,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4153,Leonard, Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
4154,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
4155,Sheldon," Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets."
4156,Eliza,Why do you say your research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets ?
4157,Raj, Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”
4158,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets .
4159,Howard," I've got one, hey Leonard, your mamma's research methodology is so flawed...."
4160,Eliza,"Really, my mamma's research methodology is so flawed ?"
4161,Leonard," Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this."
4162,Eliza,Please go on.
4163,Sheldon," No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional."
4164,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4165,Leonard," Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it."
4166,Eliza,Do you enjoy being doing it ?
4167,Sheldon, You can't. I'm the lead author.
4168,Eliza,"Oh, I can't ?"
4169,Leonard," Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically."
4170,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am the lead author is because we went alphabetically ?
4171,Sheldon," I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome."
4172,Eliza,Were you really ?
4173,Leonard," Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis."
4174,Eliza,You say Excuse you ?
4175,Sheldon, It doesn't need proving.
4176,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4177,Leonard, So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
4178,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my word? ?
4179,Sheldon," They're not supposed to, but they should."
4180,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4181,Leonard," Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings."
4182,Eliza,Is it because you are presenting our findings that you came to me ?
4183,Sheldon, And I forbid it.
4184,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4185,Leonard, You forbid it?
4186,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4187,Sheldon, If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
4188,Eliza,Do you wish that you are not taking credit for our work then nobody is ?
4189,Leonard," Oh, you admit that it's our work."
4190,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4191,Sheldon," No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome."
4192,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4193,Leonard, Ah!
4194,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4195,Howard, Oh no he dit'nt!
4196,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4197,Penny," So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?"
4198,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am guys still not talking to each other? or not ?
4199,Leonard," Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!”"
4200,Eliza,How ?
4201,Penny," Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!"
4202,Eliza,Do you say Oh for some special reason ?
4203,Leonard," They don't, that's why I saved this one."
4204,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4205,Penny," Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these."
4206,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4207,Leonard, Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
4208,Eliza,Suppose I did want you -- what would that mean ?
4209,Penny," No, this is stuff I want you to throw out."
4210,Eliza,Why not ?
4211,Leonard, Oh.
4212,Eliza,Please go on.
4213,Penny," Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this."
4214,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4215,Leonard," Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor."
4216,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4217,Penny, Uh-huh.
4218,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4219,Leonard," You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman."
4220,Eliza,"Oh, I see ?"
4221,Penny," Oh, nice."
4222,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4223,Leonard, It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
4224,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4225,Penny," Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match."
4226,Eliza,Do you believe I don't put these on while you find a shirt and sport-coat to match ?
4227,Leonard," Great, be right back."
4228,Eliza,Please go on.
4229,Penny," Well, where you going, just put them on."
4230,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4231,Leonard, Here?
4232,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4233,Penny," Oh, are you shy?"
4234,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't shy? ?
4235,Leonard," No, I'm not shy."
4236,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4237,Penny," Don't worry, I won't look."
4238,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4239,Leonard," I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing...."
4240,Eliza,Do you know I won't look anyone else ?
4241,Penny," Sweetie, put the pants on."
4242,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4243,Leonard, Putting them on.
4244,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4245,Penny," So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
4246,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4247,Leonard," No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy."
4248,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4249,Penny, What is this?
4250,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4251,Leonard," Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit."
4252,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4253,Penny," Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?"
4254,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4255,Leonard," Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit."
4256,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
4257,Penny," Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt."
4258,Eliza,Earlier you said your original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit .
4259,Leonard," Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit."
4260,Eliza,Is it important that your corduroy suit ?
4261,Penny," If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your... your only tie?"
4262,Eliza,In what way ?
4263,Leonard," Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two."
4264,Eliza,What do you know about you'll notice ?
4265,Penny," Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?"
4266,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
4267,Leonard, Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
4268,Eliza,But your corduroy suit .
4269,Penny, The... the eighth grade?
4270,Eliza,Please go on.
4271,Leonard, My last growth spurt.
4272,Eliza,Your last growth spurt ?
4273,Penny," Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit."
4274,Eliza,You say Okay ?
4275,Leonard, Great.
4276,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your last growth spurt ?
4277,Penny," Yup.  I said no, put it down."
4278,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4279,Penny, Hey Sheldon!
4280,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4281,Sheldon, Hello Penny.
4282,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
4283,Penny, Get anything good?
4284,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4285,Sheldon," Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly."
4286,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4287,Penny," Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. . It was a joke.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week."
4288,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4289,Sheldon," Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence."
4290,Eliza,"Oh, I from further awkwardness know that you are perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence ?"
4291,Penny," Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard..."
4292,Eliza,What about your own pocket ?
4293,Sheldon, Oh dear God!
4294,Eliza,Please go on.
4295,Penny," Little misunderstanding, huh."
4296,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4297,Sheldon, A little misunder.... Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
4298,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4299,Penny," Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it."
4300,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were talking to Leonard this morning and you think he feels really bad about it now ?
4301,Sheldon, Huh.
4302,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4303,Penny, Well how do you feel?
4304,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4305,Sheldon, I don't understand the question.
4306,Eliza,Don't you really understand the question ?
4307,Penny, Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
4308,Eliza,"Really, if it's difficult to be fighting with my best friend ?"
4309,Sheldon, Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
4310,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil ?
4311,Penny, Wait... what?
4312,Eliza,Please go on.
4313,Sheldon, I couldn't poop this morning.
4314,Eliza,Do you say you couldn't poop this morning for some special reason ?
4315,Penny," You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out."
4316,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4317,Sheldon, It's certainly preferable to my plan.
4318,Eliza,Why do you say your plan ?
4319,Penny, Which was?
4320,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your plan .
4321,Sheldon, A powerful laxative.
4322,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4323,Penny," Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
4324,Eliza,Does someone else believe I as a friend you ?
4325,Sheldon," Excuse me, little idea?"
4326,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4327,Penny," Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but..."
4328,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4329,Sheldon," Of course you didn't, he said little idea?"
4330,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4331,Penny," Uh, well no, no, not in... not in those words."
4332,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4333,Sheldon," In what words then, exactly"
4334,Eliza,What do you think ?
4335,Penny," Um, gee, the exact words aren't written... it's more the spirit in which it's"
4336,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4337,Sheldon, What did he say?
4338,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4339,Penny, You had a lucky hunch.
4340,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4341,Leonard," Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't...."
4342,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4343,Sheldon, Don't you ever speak to me again.
4344,Eliza,Why do you think I ever speak to you ?
4345,Leonard, What... .
4346,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4347,Penny," Uh, he... ."
4348,Eliza,Please go on.
4349,Leonard," Okay, I'm leaving for the conference."
4350,Eliza,How long have you been leaving for the conference ?
4351,Sheldon, Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
4352,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4353,Leonard, Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
4354,Eliza,You say Sheldon you didn't mean it like that ?
4355,Sheldon, Then why did you say it.
4356,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4357,Leonard," I don't know, I wasn't choosing my..."
4358,Eliza,Is it important that your ?
4359,Sheldon, Were you trying to impress Penny?
4360,Eliza,What do you think ?
4361,Leonard," No, no not at all. A little bit."
4362,Eliza,Why not ?
4363,Sheldon, How'd that work out for you?
4364,Eliza,Earlier you said your lucky hunch .
4365,Penny," Leonard, ready to go?"
4366,Eliza,But your .
4367,Sheldon," Libido 1, truth zero."
4368,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4369,Leonard," Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
4370,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be going to ask I one more time ?
4371,Sheldon," And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me."
4372,Eliza,Do you enjoy being telling I for the last time it's pandering ?
4373,Leonard, Let's go.
4374,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4375,Penny, Bye Sheldon.
4376,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4377,Sheldon," Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!"
4378,Eliza,Please go on.
4379,Penny, There you go.
4380,Eliza,"Oh, I go ?"
4381,Leonard," You're right, this side does look better."
4382,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were right ?
4383,Penny," No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained."
4384,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4385,Howard," I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
4386,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4387,Leonard, You're kidding.
4388,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be kidding .
4389,Penny, Is that all?
4390,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4391,Leonard," All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock."
4392,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4393,Penny," Oh, well, then good!"
4394,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4395,Leonard," I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous."
4396,Eliza,Is it because you are a little nervous that you came to me ?
4397,Howard," It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine."
4398,Eliza,Please go on.
4399,Leonard," A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?"
4400,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4401,Penny," Oh, sorry, I've just, I've heard it before."
4402,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
4403,Howard," Let's roll. Hey, nice suit."
4404,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4405,Leonard," It's a classic, right?"
4406,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4407,Penny, I really should have brought my own car.
4408,Eliza,Your own car ?
4409,Leonard," So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Thank you.  Are there any questions?"
4410,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4411,Voice, Yeah. What the hell was that?
4412,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4413,Leonard, Any other questions?
4414,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your own car ?
4415,Sheldon," Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.  Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero."
4416,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
4417,Leonard," I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science."
4418,Eliza,Do you say you didn't skip it for some special reason ?
4419,Sheldon," Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?"
4420,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4421,Leonard, You are not Isaac Newton.
4422,Eliza,What makes you think I am not Isaac Newton ?
4423,Sheldon," No, no that's true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple."
4424,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4425,Leonard, You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
4426,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4427,Sheldon," You continue to underestimate me, my good man."
4428,Eliza,Why do you say your good man ?
4429,Leonard," Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
4430,Eliza,Do you wish that I weren't happy with your presentation then perhaps I should have given it with you ?
4431,Sheldon," As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence."
4432,Eliza,Why don't you need validation from lesser minds ?
4433,Leonard," Really, so why did you come?"
4434,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4435,Sheldon, Because I knew you'd screw this up.
4436,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
4437,Leonard, I didn't screw it up.
4438,Eliza,You say you didn't screw it up ?
4439,Sheldon," Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there."
4440,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4441,Leonard," I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
4442,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
4443,Sheldon, So you admit that you're an egotist?
4444,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am an egotist? ?
4445,Leonard," Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse."
4446,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
4447,Sheldon," Okay, that is it."
4448,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your good man .
4449,Leonard, You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
4450,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4451,Sheldon, Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
4452,Eliza,Earlier you said your head with my mind .
4453,Leonard, Stop it.
4454,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4455,Sheldon," You hit me. You saw him, he hit me."
4456,Eliza,You like to think I saw him you -- don't you ?
4457,Leonard, You were trying to blow up my head.
4458,Eliza,Is it important that your head ?
4459,Sheldon, So it was working.
4460,Eliza,But your head .
4461,Leonard," It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase."
4462,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were a nutcase ?
4463,Sheldon," Oh we'll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
4464,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4465,Leonard," Stop, stop it, quit it."
4466,Eliza,Please go on.
4467,Penny, Is this usually how these physics things go?
4468,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4469,Howard, More often than you'd think.
4470,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4471,Leonard, Vulcan nerve pinch!
4472,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4473,Sheldon, You could have offered me a ride home.
4474,Eliza,What makes you think I could have offered you ?
4475,Leonard, You're lucky I didn't run you over.
4476,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be lucky you didn't run I over .
4477,Sheldon," I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you."
4478,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we came each other.
4479,Leonard," You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help."
4480,Eliza,What makes you think I am right ?
4481,Sheldon," Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it."
4482,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4483,Leonard, Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?
4484,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
4485,Sheldon, Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
4486,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
4487,Howard, You won't believe this.
4488,Eliza,"Oh, I won't believe this ?"
4489,Raj, Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.
4490,Eliza,Please go on.
4491,Leonard, What?
4492,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4493,Sheldon," Now, who would do that?"
4494,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4495,Howard," That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video. ."
4496,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4497,Leonard, Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
4498,Eliza,Please go on.
4499,Sheldon," Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin."
4500,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
4501,Penny," Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”"
4502,Eliza,Your Girlfriend?” ?
4503,Howard," Uh-oh, here comes “the talk.”"
4504,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your Girlfriend?” ?
4505,Student one, What losers.
4506,Eliza,What do you think ?
4507,Student two, Yeah. Gigantic American geeks.
4508,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4509,Student one,  Who's doing that?
4510,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4511,Student two," Someone from Pasadena, California named... “Wolowizard.”"
4512,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4513,Together, Awesome!
4514,Eliza,Please go on.
4515,Leonard," See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2."
4516,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4517,Sheldon," Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
4518,Eliza,What do you think about machines ?
4519,Leonard, Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
4520,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know ?
4521,Sheldon, Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
4522,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4523,Leonard," Alright, oh wait, they use it to in..."
4524,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4525,Sheldon," , too late, I win."
4526,Eliza,Do you say for some special reason ?
4527,Penny, Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
4528,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4529,Leonard, What the hell is that?
4530,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4531,Sheldon," I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too. ."
4532,Eliza,What do you know about cats could sing ?
4533,Penny," You wanna prowl, be my night owl,  we'll take my...  Hey guys, hi! Where you going?"
4534,Eliza,Why do you say your ?
4535,Leonard, What? Oh we just had to... mail some letters and  throw away some chicken.
4536,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your .
4537,Penny, You'll never guess what just happened.
4538,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4539,Leonard," Oh, I give up."
4540,Eliza,You say Oh ?
4541,Sheldon," I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot."
4542,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4543,Penny, What was that?
4544,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4545,Leonard," Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?"
4546,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4547,Penny," Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?"
4548,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4549,Sheldon, I have a conclusion based on an observation.
4550,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4551,Leonard, No you don't. No he doesn't.
4552,Eliza,Why not ?
4553,Penny," Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her."
4554,Eliza,Earlier you said your response moot .
4555,Leonard," Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
4556,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4557,Penny," It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know."
4558,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4559,Sheldon, I think I know.
4560,Eliza,Do you really doubt you ?
4561,Leonard, No you don't. He doesn't.
4562,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4563,Penny," It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?"
4564,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4565,Together, No.
4566,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4567,Leonard," Because.... uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
4568,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
4569,Sheldon, I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
4570,Eliza,Do you say you think that's a week from Tuesday at six for some special reason ?
4571,Leonard," No, it's this Friday, at eight."
4572,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4573,Penny," Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys."
4574,Eliza,Do you wish to got to get to rehearsal me ?
4575,Leonard, See you.
4576,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4577,Sheldon, You just lied to Penny.
4578,Eliza,"Oh, I just lied to Penny ?"
4579,Leonard," Yes, I did."
4580,Eliza,You are sure.
4581,Sheldon," And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
4582,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4583,Leonard, So?
4584,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4585,Sheldon," So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath."
4586,Eliza,Please go on.
4587,Leonard," Sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
4588,Eliza,Perhaps I am worried about my safety in your fantasies.
4589,Sheldon," No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago."
4590,Eliza,"Really, if I was going to kill you you'd have done it a long time ago ?"
4591,Leonard, That's very true.
4592,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4593,Sheldon,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard..."
4594,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4595,Leonard, What?
4596,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4597,Sheldon, I need to speak to you.
4598,Eliza,Suppose you got to speak to I soon ?
4599,Leonard, It's two o'clock in the morning
4600,Eliza,Please go on.
4601,Sheldon, It's important.
4602,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4603,Leonard, I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?
4604,Eliza,You seem to need to highly doubt that me.
4605,Sheldon, Yes.
4606,Eliza,I see.
4607,Leonard, What?
4608,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4609,Sheldon," You're right, it can wait until morning."
4610,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am right ?
4611,Leonard," What, what, what, what, what?"
4612,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4613,Sheldon," Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you're in no state to talk."
4614,Eliza,Do you clearly woke I up in the middle of a REM cycle anyone else ?
4615,Leonard," Sheldon, what is it?"
4616,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4617,Sheldon, I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
4618,Eliza,How long have you been uncomfortable having been included in my lie to Penny ?
4619,Leonard, What was I supposed to say.
4620,Eliza,What if you were supposed to say ?
4621,Sheldon, You could have told her the truth.
4622,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4623,Leonard, That would have hurt her feelings.
4624,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4625,Sheldon, Is that a relevant factor?
4626,Eliza,Please go on.
4627,Leonard, Yes.
4628,Eliza,I understand.
4629,Sheldon, Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
4630,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we suppose each other.
4631,Leonard, And what would I have said afterwards?
4632,Eliza,What do you think ?
4633,Sheldon," I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
4634,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I disagree ?
4635,Leonard," I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again."
4636,Eliza,Do you really want to be able to wait to hear I sing again ?
4637,Sheldon, Why?
4638,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4639,Leonard," It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at."
4640,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4641,Sheldon, I was not aware of that.
4642,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were not aware of that .
4643,Leonard, Well now you are.
4644,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were ?
4645,Sheldon," Oh, alright. Leonard."
4646,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4647,Leonard, Yes.
4648,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
4649,Sheldon," When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight."
4650,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4651,Sheldon,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard, ....."
4652,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4653,Leonard, Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?
4654,Eliza,Do you wish that you was a violent sociopath ?
4655,Sheldon," I was analysing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse."
4656,Eliza,Were you really ?
4657,Leonard, How?
4658,Eliza,Please go on.
4659,Sheldon," Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire."
4660,Eliza,What do you know about she was to log on to www ?
4661,Sheldon," Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today."
4662,Eliza,Is it important that your trousers will not be igniting today ?
4663,Sheldon,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Good morning."
4664,Eliza,But your trousers will not be igniting today .
4665,Penny, Do you have any idea what time it is?
4666,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4667,Sheldon," Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
4668,Eliza,Your watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder ?
4669,Penny, What do you want?
4670,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4671,Sheldon, Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
4672,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4673,Penny, I remember symposium.
4674,Eliza,What else do you recollect ?
4675,Sheldon," Yes, well, he lied."
4676,Eliza,You are sure.
4677,Penny," Wait, what?"
4678,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder ?
4679,Sheldon," He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it."
4680,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be feeling very uncomfortable about it ?
4681,Penny, Well imagine how I'm feeling.
4682,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4683,Sheldon, Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.
4684,Eliza,Why do you say your strong suit ?
4685,Leonard," You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?"
4686,Eliza,"Oh, I tell her you lied? ?"
4687,Sheldon, To help you.
4688,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4689,Leonard," I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help."
4690,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not seeing the help ?
4691,Sheldon," She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me."
4692,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's lie eventually ?
4693,Leonard," Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling."
4694,Eliza,Is it because you are getting a bad feeling that you came to me ?
4695,Sheldon," Hunger? Indigestion, I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention."
4696,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4697,Leonard, Your cousin Leopold?
4698,Eliza,"Really, my cousin Leopold? ?"
4699,Sheldon," Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it's important."
4700,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your strong suit .
4701,Leonard, What's important?
4702,Eliza,Earlier you said your cousin Leopold's drug intervention .
4703,Sheldon," Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details."
4704,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4705,Leonard, Do you have a cousin Leopold.
4706,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4707,Sheldon," No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee."
4708,Eliza,Why not ?
4709,Leonard," I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
4710,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
4711,Sheldon," Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web."
4712,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were weaving an un-unravelable web now ?
4713,Leonard, Un-unravelable?
4714,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4715,Sheldon," Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
4716,Eliza,"Really, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page ?"
4717,Leonard," Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
4718,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4719,Sheldon," Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive."
4720,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
4721,Leonard, We're going to Long Beach?
4722,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4723,Sheldon," No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard."
4724,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4725,Leonard," Oh, come on!"
4726,Eliza,Please go on.
4727,Sheldon," We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
4728,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4729,Leonard, So he goes back into rehab?
4730,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4731,Sheldon," Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
4732,Eliza,Do you think its likely that Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again ?
4733,Leonard, You still told her I lied.
4734,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4735,Sheldon," For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
4736,Eliza,How long have you been assuming is embarrassing ?
4737,Leonard, I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
4738,Eliza,Don't you really know ?
4739,Sheldon," That's the best part, you don't have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force."
4740,Eliza,Do you wish that the original lie was still in force ?
4741,Leonard," So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?"
4742,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4743,Sheldon, Un-unravelable.
4744,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4745,Leonard," Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
4746,Eliza,"Oh, I look great ?"
4747,Penny, Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
4748,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4749,Leonard," Oh, well, thankyou."
4750,Eliza,Please go on.
4751,Penny," You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... when he has a symposium to go to."
4752,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be the kind of guy who stands by a friend what .
4753,Leonard, I don't know what to say.
4754,Eliza,Why don't you know what to say ?
4755,Penny," It's okay, Leonard"
4756,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4757,Leonard," Oh, okay, alright, good."
4758,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4759,Howard," Oh boy, group hug."
4760,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4761,Penny, Uh-huh!
4762,Eliza,Please go on.
4763,Howard, Uh-huh?
4764,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4765,Penny, Uh-huh!
4766,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4767,Howard, Okay. So what's up?
4768,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4769,Sheldon," Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."
4770,Eliza,What if they were not going to a symposium on molecular positronium ?
4771,Howard," Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're Bogarding the symposium."
4772,Eliza,What makes you think I am Bogarding the symposium ?
4773,Leonard," Howard, I'm sorry... we're... we're"
4774,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
4775,Howard," No, no, you're quark-blocking us."
4776,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4777,Leonard, I don't know what to say.
4778,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know what to say ?
4779,Howard, Wow.
4780,Eliza,Please go on.
4781,Leonard," Howard, listen..."
4782,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4783,Howard," No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening."
4784,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4785,Penny," Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them."
4786,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4787,Sheldon," Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that."
4788,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
4789,Penny," There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard."
4790,Eliza,Why not ?
4791,Leonard, Well... I don't know what to say.
4792,Eliza,Don't you really know what to say ?
4793,Penny," It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian"
4794,Eliza,You say It's okay ?
4795,Sheldon, Good for you.
4796,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4797,Penny," Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
4798,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
4799,Howard," No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step."
4800,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4801,Penny," No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man."
4802,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4803,Leonard," Oh, another hug, thank you."
4804,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4805,Penny," Alright you guys, good luck."
4806,Eliza,"Oh, I guys ?"
4807,Leonard, Thanks Penny.
4808,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4809,Howard," Yeah, uh, break a leg."
4810,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4811,Sheldon, Break a leg.
4812,Eliza,Please go on.
4813,Howard," So, road trip to Long Beach."
4814,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4815,Leonard," No, we're not going to Long Beach."
4816,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4817,Raj, Why not?
4818,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4819,Leonard, Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
4820,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
4821,Raj," Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach."
4822,Eliza,Can you think of a specific example ?
4823,Sheldon," It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner."
4824,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4825,Raj, Sounds fun.
4826,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4827,Howard, I'm game.
4828,Eliza,Do you enjoy being game ?
4829,Raj, Shotgun.
4830,Eliza,Please go on.
4831,Sheldon," No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy."
4832,Eliza,Why not ?
4833,Leonard," Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?"
4834,Eliza,Possibly they are we really going to Long Beach? .
4835,Sheldon,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard..."
4836,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4837,Leonard," Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not."
4838,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4839,Sheldon," No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie."
4840,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
4841,Leonard," What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over."
4842,Eliza,What do you think ?
4843,Sheldon," Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
4844,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
4845,Leonard, Why not?
4846,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4847,Sheldon, Because Leo is a middle child.
4848,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
4849,Leonard," There is no Leo, how can you say that?"
4850,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
4851,Sheldon," You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
4852,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4853,Leonard, I've got a solution.
4854,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4855,Sheldon," Great, what is it?"
4856,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4857,Leonard, Get out.
4858,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4859,Sheldon," Fine.  I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.  We'll talk in the morning."
4860,Eliza,Is it because you are just trying to clean up after my mess that you came to me ?
4861,Strange man, Morning.
4862,Eliza,Please go on.
4863,Leonard, Who are you?
4864,Eliza,Did you think they might not be you? ?
4865,Man, I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.
4866,Eliza,How long have you been Sheldon's cousin Leo ?
4867,Leonard," Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
4868,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4869,Man," Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem."
4870,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
4871,Sheldon," Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
4872,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my unmet need for attention ?
4873,Man," Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology."
4874,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not we really going to go with pop psychology ?
4875,Sheldon," For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you."
4876,Eliza,What about your own information ?
4877,Leonard, Sheldon?
4878,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4879,Sheldon," I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT."
4880,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
4881,Toby, It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
4882,Eliza,Is it important that your bourgeois parents pushed you towards ?
4883,Leonard," Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?"
4884,Eliza,Do you say Yeah for some special reason ?
4885,Sheldon," Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
4886,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4887,Leonard, Oh...!
4888,Eliza,But your bourgeois parents pushed you towards .
4889,Toby," Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain."
4890,Eliza,Your motivation ?
4891,Sheldon," No. We're going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
4892,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
4893,Toby," Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?"
4894,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4895,Sheldon," Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny."
4896,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your motivation ?
4897,Penny, Hi. How did the intervention go.
4898,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4899,Sheldon," Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab."
4900,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4901,Penny," Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised."
4902,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4903,Sheldon," But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour."
4904,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
4905,Penny," Hi Leo, how are you feeling?"
4906,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
4907,Toby," Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?"
4908,Eliza,"Oh, I ever woken up in a fleabag motel ?"
4909,Penny, No.
4910,Eliza,Why not ?
4911,Toby, Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
4912,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
4913,Leonard," Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?"
4914,Eliza,Perhaps I will tell you about my showcase last night? in good time.
4915,Penny," Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it."
4916,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
4917,Leonard, There were only two people there?
4918,Eliza,Please go on.
4919,Penny, By the end. Yeah.
4920,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4921,Toby," Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!"
4922,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
4923,Penny, I'm... I'm sorry.
4924,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sorry ?
4925,Toby," The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away."
4926,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
4927,Sheldon, Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
4928,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4929,Toby, That's never been proven.
4930,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4931,Sheldon, There have been studies.
4932,Eliza,Please go on.
4933,Toby, Not double blind studies.
4934,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4935,Sheldon," How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group."
4936,Eliza,What do you think ?
4937,Leonard," As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy."
4938,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
4939,Penny," Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
4940,Eliza,Why do you say your place ?
4941,Leonard, Sounds good.
4942,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your place .
4943,Penny," I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?"
4944,Eliza,Do you wish to have a video of you singing last night me ?
4945,Leonard," Gee, why wouldn't I?"
4946,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
4947,Penny," This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me."
4948,Eliza,"Really, I watch you ?"
4949,Leonard, Yeah! Funny how things work out.
4950,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
4951,Toby, And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
4952,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4953,Sheldon, Your parents made the right decision.
4954,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's parents made the right decision ?
4955,Toby, I cannot work like this!
4956,Eliza,How do you think that you can't work like this! ?
4957,Toby," This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or... or... wondering if you're a dude down there."
4958,Eliza,What do you know about I are a dude down there ?
4959,Penny," Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay."
4960,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am gonna do okay ?
4961,Toby," One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time."
4962,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4963,Leonard, How long is he going to stay here.
4964,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
4965,Sheldon," He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
4966,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
4967,Sheldon, Checkmate.
4968,Eliza,Please go on.
4969,Leonard, O-o-o-o-h! Again?
4970,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4971,Sheldon," Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed."
4972,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were not well suited for three-dimensional chess ?
4973,Leonard, Just reset the board.
4974,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4975,Sheldon, It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
4976,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4977,Penny, Hi guys.
4978,Eliza,Please go on.
4979,Leonard, Hey!
4980,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
4981,Penny, Did you get my mail.
4982,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
4983,Leonard," Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?"
4984,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
4985,Penny," Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska."
4986,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
4987,Sheldon, From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
4988,Eliza,"Oh, I can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here ?"
4989,Penny," Boy, it's good to be back."
4990,Eliza,Earlier you said your mail .
4991,Leonard, How was your family?
4992,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
4993,Penny," Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
4994,Eliza,"You have a particular person in mind, don't you ?"
4995,Sheldon, Sick?
4996,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
4997,Leonard, Here we go.
4998,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
4999,Sheldon, What kind of sick?
5000,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5001,Penny," Oh, the flu I guess."
5002,Eliza,You say Oh ?
5003,Sheldon," I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
5004,Eliza,What if you never got I to know ?
5005,Penny, Maybe Friday.
5006,Eliza,Can't you be more positive ?
5007,Sheldon," Friday, was that morning or afternoon?"
5008,Eliza,Please go on.
5009,Penny, I... I don't...
5010,Eliza,Why don't you ?
5011,Sheldon," Think woman, who blew their nose and when?"
5012,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5013,Leonard," Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious."
5014,Eliza,Is it because you are sure she's not contagious that you came to me ?
5015,Sheldon," Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose."
5016,Eliza,"Really, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago ?"
5017,Leonard," Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe."
5018,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5019,Penny," Oh, it's okay, I understand."
5020,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5021,Sheldon," Thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
5022,Eliza,"Really, my consideration ?"
5023,Leonard, You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
5024,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5025,Penny," Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail."
5026,Eliza,Is it important that your mail ?
5027,Leonard, No problem. Welcome home.
5028,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5029,Sheldon, What?
5030,Eliza,But your mail .
5031,Leonard, What the hell are you doing?
5032,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5033,Sheldon, I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
5034,Eliza,How long have you been making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures ?
5035,Leonard, With lime jello?
5036,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5037,Sheldon," I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat."
5038,Eliza,Your throat ?
5039,Leonard, I don't think so.
5040,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to think so ?
5041,Sheldon, Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
5042,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you are going to get ahead of this thing you need to find out what's growing in your throat ?
5043,Leonard," Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not."
5044,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be not .
5045,Sheldon, We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
5046,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
5047,Leonard," Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?"
5048,Eliza,What makes you think I am overreacting? ?
5049,Sheldon," When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance."
5050,Eliza,Why do you say your accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance ?
5051,Leonard, I'm going back to bed.
5052,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be going back to bed ?
5053,Sheldon, Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.
5054,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance .
5055,Leonard, What for?
5056,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5057,Sheldon, I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
5058,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5059,Leonard, I mix pancake batter in this!
5060,Eliza,Do you say you mix pancake batter in this! for some special reason ?
5061,Sheldon," No, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
5062,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
5063,Leonard," You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?"
5064,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5065,Sheldon, It's right here on the bottom.
5066,Eliza,Earlier you said your kidneys aren't shutting down .
5067,Leonard, Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
5068,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5069,Sheldon," Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, I'm sick!"
5070,Eliza,Do you enjoy being sick! ?
5071,Sheldon, Leonard! Leonard I'm sick!
5072,Eliza,Is it because you are sick! that you came to me ?
5073,Sheldon," Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!"
5074,Eliza,Is it important that your sinuses hurt what you bend over ?
5075,Leonard, Hey.
5076,Eliza,But your sinuses hurt what you bend over .
5077,Sheldon," Leonard, where are you?"
5078,Eliza,What if they were not you? ?
5079,Leonard, I'm at work.
5080,Eliza,How long have you been at work ?
5081,Sheldon, At six-thirty in the morning?
5082,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your throat ?
5083,Leonard, Yes.
5084,Eliza,I see.
5085,Sheldon, On Sunday?
5086,Eliza,Please go on.
5087,Leonard, Yes.
5088,Eliza,I understand.
5089,Sheldon, Why?
5090,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5091,Leonard, They asked me to come in.
5092,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5093,Sheldon," Well, I didn't hear the phone ring."
5094,Eliza,You say Well ?
5095,Leonard, They texted me.
5096,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5097,Sheldon," Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate."
5098,Eliza,Your fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am ?
5099,Leonard, No kidding?
5100,Eliza,Why not ?
5101,Sheldon," No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green."
5102,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5103,Leonard," Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids."
5104,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am ?
5105,Sheldon, What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
5106,Eliza,What do you think ?
5107,Leonard, Drink whatever you want.
5108,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5109,Sheldon, I want soup.
5110,Eliza,What would getting soup mean to you ?
5111,Leonard, Then make soup.
5112,Eliza,Please go on.
5113,Sheldon, We don't have soup.
5114,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5115,Leonard," I'm at work, Sheldon."
5116,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be at work ?
5117,Sheldon, Is that a dog?
5118,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5119,Leonard," Yes,"
5120,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
5121,Sheldon, In the lab?
5122,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5123,Leonard," Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go."
5124,Eliza,You are sure.
5125,Howard's Mother," Howard, it's the phone."
5126,Eliza,Please go on.
5127,Howard," I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone."
5128,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5129,Howard's Mother, Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?
5130,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5131,Howard, I don't know.
5132,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
5133,Howard's Mother, Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.
5134,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
5135,Howard, How can I ask them when I'm talking to you!  Hello.
5136,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
5137,Leonard," Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green."
5138,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5139,Howard," Dear Lord, not Milky Green!"
5140,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5141,Leonard," Affirmative, with fever."
5142,Eliza,Please go on.
5143,Howard's Mother, Who's on the phone.
5144,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5145,Howard, It's Leonard.
5146,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5147,Howard's Mother, Why is he calling.
5148,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
5149,Howard, Sheldon's sick.
5150,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5151,Howard's Mother, Were you playing with him?
5152,Eliza,Perhaps I was playing with him? .
5153,Howard," For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old."
5154,Eliza,Do you enjoy being twenty six years old ?
5155,Howard's Mother, Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
5156,Eliza,Please go on.
5157,Howard, Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
5158,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5159,Leonard," Howard, listen to me."
5160,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5161,Howard," Hang on, call waiting."
5162,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5163,Leonard," No, don't, don't...."
5164,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
5165,Howard, Hello.
5166,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
5167,Sheldon," Howard, I'm sick."
5168,Eliza,Do you think that coming here will help you not to be sick ?
5169,Howard," Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?"
5170,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
5171,Sheldon, I need soup.
5172,Eliza,What does wanting soup have to do with this discussion ?
5173,Howard, Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.
5174,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my own mother ?
5175,Leonard, I tried to stop you.
5176,Eliza,You seem to need to tried to stop me.
5177,Howard," It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06."
5178,Eliza,Why do you say your own fault ?
5179,Leonard," You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours."
5180,Eliza,"Oh, I call Koothrappali ?"
5181,Howard," Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?"
5182,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5183,Howard's Mother, I just had the carpets steamed.
5184,Eliza,Do you say you just had the carpets steamed for some special reason ?
5185,Howard, That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.
5186,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your own fault .
5187,Leonard," Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start."
5188,Eliza,Earlier you said your friends come over? .
5189,Waitress, Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.
5190,Eliza,Please go on.
5191,Penny," No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
5192,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
5193,Sheldon," I'm sick, thank you very much."
5194,Eliza,I'm sure it's not pleasant to be sick .
5195,Penny," How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick."
5196,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
5197,Sheldon, You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!
5198,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am doomed! ?
5199,Penny," Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want."
5200,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5201,Sheldon, I want soup.
5202,Eliza,What would it mean to you if you got soup ?
5203,Penny, Why didn't you just....  Why didn't you just have soup at home.
5204,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5205,Sheldon," Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?"
5206,Eliza,Do you wish that there was a way for you to have had soup at home you would have thought of it? ?
5207,Penny, You can have soup delivered.
5208,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5209,Sheldon," I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for."
5210,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5211,Penny," Okay, what kind of soup do you want."
5212,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5213,Sheldon," Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
5214,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your mother ?
5215,Penny, We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
5216,Eliza,But your mother used to make you this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons .
5217,Sheldon, Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
5218,Eliza,What do you think ?
5219,Penny, No.
5220,Eliza,Why not ?
5221,Sheldon, Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green?
5222,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5223,Howard," Look at this, everyone went chimp."
5224,Eliza,Who do you think you're talking about ?
5225,Raj," Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ."
5226,Eliza,Do you voted for orang-utan anyone else ?
5227,Leonard," Oh, hi Penny!"
5228,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5229,Penny," Hey, where are you?"
5230,Eliza,Possibly they are you? .
5231,Leonard, I'm... uh... at work.
5232,Eliza,Is it because you are that you came to me ?
5233,Penny, You sound funny.
5234,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5235,Leonard, I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?
5236,Eliza,How long have you been in a radiation suit ?
5237,Penny," Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station."
5238,Eliza,Is it important that your entire station ?
5239,Leonard, Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.  Just tell him to go home.
5240,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your entire station ?
5241,Penny," He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
5242,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5243,Leonard," He's paranoid, and he's established a nest."
5244,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5245,Penny, Can you please come get him?
5246,Eliza,You believe I can please come get him? don't you ?
5247,Leonard," Uh, yeah, I'd be... I'd be happy to Penny.  Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit  The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!  I feel really guilty."
5248,Eliza,Your God ?
5249,Raj, You did what you had to do.
5250,Eliza,"Oh, I had to do ?"
5251,Howard, Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
5252,Eliza,Why do you say your popcorn I damn dirty ape ?
5253,Sheldon, Thanks for bringing me home.
5254,Eliza,Earlier you said your popcorn I damn dirty ape .
5255,Penny," Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything."
5256,Eliza,You say Oh ?
5257,Sheldon, Good. Good.
5258,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your God .
5259,Penny," Okay, well, you feel better."
5260,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5261,Sheldon," Wait, where are you going?"
5262,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am going? ?
5263,Penny," Um, home, to write some bad cheques."
5264,Eliza,Please go on.
5265,Sheldon, You're going to leave me?
5266,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were going to leave me? ?
5267,Penny," Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?"
5268,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be a grown man .
5269,Sheldon," Well, of course, but, not by myself."
5270,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5271,Penny," Really, never?"
5272,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5273,Sheldon," Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany."
5274,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were fifteen .
5275,Penny, Studying abroad?
5276,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5277,Sheldon," No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia."
5278,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5279,Penny, And there was no-one there to take care of you?
5280,Eliza,But your lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia .
5281,Sheldon," No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again."
5282,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
5283,Penny, Again?
5284,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again ?
5285,Sheldon," It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”"
5286,Eliza,Were you really ?
5287,Penny, What does that mean?
5288,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
5289,Sheldon," Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
5290,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
5291,Penny," Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?"
5292,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5293,Sheldon," Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths."
5294,Eliza,Who else in your family used to give you sponge baths ?
5295,Penny," Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas."
5296,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5297,Sheldon, Agreed.
5298,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your mom used to give you sponge baths .
5299,Raj," Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness."
5300,Eliza,Please go on.
5301,Leonard," Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
5302,Eliza,Is it important that your glasses ?
5303,Howard, Sorry.  Found ‘em.
5304,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
5305,Leonard, Oh great.
5306,Eliza,Earlier you said your glasses .
5307,Howard," Sorry, don't you have a spare."
5308,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
5309,Leonard," Yeah, at home."
5310,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5311,Raj," Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston."
5312,Eliza,What do you know about I leave now ?
5313,Howard," Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web."
5314,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5315,Leonard," Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye.  He's home, I'm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness."
5316,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were wondering now ?
5317,Raj, How about Lasic?
5318,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
5319,Leonard, You want me to get eye surgery?
5320,Eliza,Do you wish to believe I want you ?
5321,Raj," Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
5322,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5323,Howard, Well?
5324,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5325,Leonard, I'm thinking!
5326,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be thinking! ?
5327,Penny," Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later."
5328,Eliza,"Oh, I later ?"
5329,Sheldon, Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
5330,Eliza,Your chest ?
5331,Penny," Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?"
5332,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5333,Sheldon, Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
5334,Eliza,Why do you say your hands smell funny ?
5335,Penny, But Sheldon....
5336,Eliza,But your chest .
5337,Sheldon," Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
5338,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your hands smell funny ?
5339,Penny, I can't believe I'm doing this.
5340,Eliza,Do you enjoy being doing this ?
5341,Sheldon," No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats."
5342,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5343,Penny, Sorry.
5344,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
5345,Sheldon, Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.
5346,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
5347,Penny, What?
5348,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your chest hair mats .
5349,Sheldon, My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
5350,Eliza,Your mom ?
5351,Penny," I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it."
5352,Eliza,Is it because you are sorry that you came to me ?
5353,Sheldon," I'll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you."
5354,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5355,Penny," Soft kitty, warm kitty..."
5356,Eliza,Earlier you said your mom used to sing it to you what you was sick .
5357,Sheldon, Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
5358,Eliza,Please go on.
5359,Penny, Little ball of fur.
5360,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5361,Leonard," What do you see, what do you see."
5362,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
5363,Raj, The living room appears to be empty.
5364,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5365,Leonard," Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal."
5366,Eliza,Is it important that your Bat-signal ?
5367,Howard, I'm not going in there.
5368,Eliza,How long have you been not going in there ?
5369,Leonard, Raj?
5370,Eliza,But your Bat-signal .
5371,Raj," No way, Jose."
5372,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
5373,Leonard," Well I can't do it, I can't see anything."
5374,Eliza,Have you tried ?
5375,Howard," It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes."
5376,Eliza,What about your own eyes ?
5377,Leonard, Fine.
5378,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5379,Howard," One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
5380,Eliza,"Really, if Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk ?"
5381,Leonard, Won't my footsteps set it off?
5382,Eliza,Your footsteps set it off? ?
5383,Howard," No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room."
5384,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
5385,Leonard," Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?"
5386,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you are on your hands and knees? ?
5387,Howard, Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
5388,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your footsteps set it off? ?
5389,Leonard, What?
5390,Eliza,Please go on.
5391,Howard, It means go straight.
5392,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5393,Leonard, Then just say go straight.
5394,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5395,Howard," You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true."
5396,Eliza,What makes you think I am giving bearings ?
5397,Leonard, Alright  I just hit my head.
5398,Eliza,Why do you say your head ?
5399,Howard," Because you didn't keep true.  Okay, turn right."
5400,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
5401,Raj, The... the picture's breaking up.
5402,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your head .
5403,Howard," Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  That's it, now just keep true. Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on."
5404,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's head to the right ?
5405,Leonard, It wasn't on?
5406,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5407,Howard, No.
5408,Eliza,Why not ?
5409,Leonard, Then why did I have to crawl?
5410,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5411,Howard," Oh, I guess you didn't."
5412,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we guess each other.
5413,Leonard," Okay, it's on."
5414,Eliza,Please go on.
5415,Howard, Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.
5416,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5417,Leonard, I know.
5418,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5419,Howard," Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back."
5420,Eliza,"Really, my head back ?"
5421,Penny, You rat bastard.
5422,Eliza,"Oh, I rat bastard ?"
5423,Howard, Told you the sensor would work.
5424,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5425,Leonard, Hi!
5426,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5427,Penny, You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
5428,Eliza,Suppose I did deliberately stuck you -- what would that mean ?
5429,Leonard," Well, I had to, you see what he's like."
5430,Eliza,Do you wish to had to me ?
5431,Sheldon," Penny! Penny, I'm hungry."
5432,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be hungry ?
5433,Penny," Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!"
5434,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5435,Leonard, No!
5436,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5437,Penny," Here you go, good luck, bye."
5438,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5439,Leonard, W-wait!
5440,Eliza,Please go on.
5441,Sheldon," Leonard, I'm hungry!"
5442,Eliza,Do you enjoy being hungry! ?
5443,Leonard, Wait! Penny! Take me with you!
5444,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5445,Sheldon, I want grilled cheese.
5446,Eliza,Why do you want grilled cheese ?
5447,Sheldon, Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
5448,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5449,Leonard, I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
5450,Eliza,Don't you really think Penny's ever coming here again ?
5451,Sheldon, I'm very congested.
5452,Eliza,Is it because you are very congested that you came to me ?
5453,Leonard," Yeah, so?"
5454,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5455,Sheldon," Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
5456,Eliza,You want me to be able to go to the kitchen .
5457,Leonard," If I stand, I'll vomit."
5458,Eliza,Do you wish that you stand ?
5459,Sheldon," Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
5460,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5461,Sheldon, Here's the problem with teleportation.
5462,Eliza,Please go on.
5463,Leonard, Lay it on me.
5464,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5465,Sheldon," Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
5466,Eliza,"Oh, I would have destroyed him in one location ?"
5467,Leonard, How about that.
5468,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5469,Sheldon," Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."
5470,Eliza,Do you say Personally for some special reason ?
5471,Leonard, Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
5472,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5473,Sheldon," No, he would be exactly the same."
5474,Eliza,How ?
5475,Leonard, That is a problem.
5476,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5477,Sheldon," So, you see it too."
5478,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5479,Dr Gablehouser," Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper."
5480,Eliza,Please go on.
5481,Together, Dr Gablehouser.
5482,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5483,Gablehouser," Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here."
5484,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5485,Leonard," Graduate work, very impressive."
5486,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5487,Gablehouser, And he's only fifteen years old.
5488,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5489,Sheldon," Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen."
5490,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5491,Dennis," Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea."
5492,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your family ?
5493,Leonard, Advantage Kim.
5494,Eliza,Earlier you said your family was tunnelling out of North Korea .
5495,Gablehouser," I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country."
5496,Eliza,You seem to need to thought perhaps me.
5497,Dennis," I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end."
5498,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
5499,Sheldon," Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
5500,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5501,Dennis," Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will."
5502,Eliza,Does someone else believe I don't see it yet you ?
5503,Gablehouser," Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen."
5504,Eliza,What do you know about I want to use up to 20% of the grant money I attract to smuggle my grandfather out of Pyongyang ?
5505,Leonard, Yes sir.
5506,Eliza,I see.
5507,Sheldon," You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end."
5508,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5509,Dennis," I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition... ooh, look, chocolate milk."
5510,Eliza,You say you mean ?
5511,Sheldon, I sense a disturbance in the force.
5512,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5513,Leonard," A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm."
5514,Eliza,Do you say A bad feeling you have about this for some special reason ?
5515,Leonard," So, Dennis, how long have you been in America."
5516,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5517,Dennis, A year and a half.
5518,Eliza,But your research .
5519,Leonard," No kidding, you speak English really well."
5520,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5521,Dennis, So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
5522,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
5523,Leonard, What are you talking about?
5524,Eliza,What do you think ?
5525,Dennis, That.
5526,Eliza,Please go on.
5527,Sheldon," He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office."
5528,Eliza,Is it important that your office ?
5529,Dennis, Is this part of the tour?
5530,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your office ?
5531,Sheldon, Nope. Goodbye.
5532,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5533,Leonard," Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything."
5534,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5535,Sheldon," Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye."
5536,Eliza,Your door ?
5537,Dennis, Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
5538,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am doing work in quantum loop corrections ?
5539,Sheldon," Keen observation, goodbye."
5540,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your door .
5541,Dennis," You see where you went wrong, don't you?"
5542,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5543,Sheldon, Leonard.
5544,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5545,Leonard," Huh, yeah?"
5546,Eliza,Please go on.
5547,Sheldon, Get him out.
5548,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5549,Leonard," Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment."
5550,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5551,Dennis, Do I look like I lift weights.
5552,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5553,Leonard, Not heavy ones.
5554,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5555,Dennis, It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
5556,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5557,Sheldon, You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
5558,Eliza,"Oh, I really think you haven't considered it? ?"
5559,Dennis, Have you considered it?
5560,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5561,Sheldon, Get him out Leonard.
5562,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5563,Leonard," Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab."
5564,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5565,Dennis," Wow, you won the Stephenson award."
5566,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5567,Sheldon," Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it."
5568,Eliza,I understand.
5569,Dennis," Really, how old?"
5570,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
5571,Sheldon, Fourteen and a half.
5572,Eliza,Please go on.
5573,Dennis, You were the youngest person ever to win it.
5574,Eliza,"Oh, I was the youngest person ever to win it ?"
5575,Leonard," It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?"
5576,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5577,Penny," Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it?  Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?  Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged."
5578,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were so damaged ?
5579,Howard," Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?"
5580,Eliza,How long have you been damaged too ?
5581,Penny," Sure. Raj, hug Howard."
5582,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5583,Sheldon, Uh-uh-uh.
5584,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5585,Leonard, Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
5586,Eliza,You aren't sure ?
5587,Sheldon," Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to... you know, that other guy."
5588,Eliza,Why do you say your work ?
5589,Howard, Antonio Salieri?
5590,Eliza,Earlier you said your work .
5591,Sheldon," Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me."
5592,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be smarter than you .
5593,Howard," You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them."
5594,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5595,Leonard," Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better."
5596,Eliza,Please go on.
5597,Sheldon," Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes."
5598,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
5599,Penny," I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?"
5600,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be confused ?
5601,Leonard, You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
5602,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5603,Sheldon," Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg."
5604,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
5605,Penny," So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is."
5606,Eliza,You say So ?
5607,Sheldon," Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything."
5608,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5609,Penny," I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?"
5610,Eliza,Why don't you understand ?
5611,Howard, We liked Leonard.
5612,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5613,Leonard," Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?"
5614,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
5615,Sheldon," Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die."
5616,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
5617,Penny," You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
5618,Eliza,"Oh, I know ?"
5619,Sheldon, Hey.
5620,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5621,Leonard, Hey.
5622,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5623,Sheldon, I've decided you're right. My career is not over.
5624,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5625,Leonard, Great.
5626,Eliza,But your career is not over .
5627,Sheldon," But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on."
5628,Eliza,Is it important that your research pointless ?
5629,Leonard, Great.
5630,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your research pointless ?
5631,Sheldon," So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you."
5632,Eliza,Do you enjoy being going to collaborate with I ?
5633,Leonard, Great.
5634,Eliza,Please go on.
5635,Sheldon," What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention."
5636,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
5637,Leonard," Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help."
5638,Eliza,Is it because you are designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level that you came to me ?
5639,Sheldon," Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
5640,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5641,Leonard, Yes.
5642,Eliza,You are sure.
5643,Sheldon, No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
5644,Eliza,"Really, if I use argon lasers instead of helium neon? ?"
5645,Leonard, It would blow up.
5646,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5647,Sheldon, Are you sure?
5648,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
5649,Leonard, Pretty sure.
5650,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5651,Sheldon," Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
5652,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5653,Leonard," Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully."
5654,Eliza,Suppose you got I to listen carefully soon ?
5655,Sheldon, Alright.
5656,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5657,Leonard, Go away.
5658,Eliza,Please go on.
5659,Sheldon," If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first... I'm going."
5660,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
5661,Howard," It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?"
5662,Eliza,How long have you been looking at it right now ?
5663,Sheldon," So, this is engineering, huh?"
5664,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5665,Howard, I'll talk to you later.
5666,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5667,Sheldon," Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
5668,Eliza,Do you dream often ?
5669,Howard," Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
5670,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5671,Sheldon, I just came by to say hello.
5672,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5673,Howard," I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello."
5674,Eliza,How do you do. Please state your problem.
5675,Sheldon," Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?"
5676,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5677,Howard, A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.
5678,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5679,Sheldon," Really, how does it work?"
5680,Eliza,What do you think ?
5681,Howard," When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it."
5682,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
5683,Sheldon," Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?"
5684,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5685,Howard," No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide... yeah, okay, it's a shelf."
5686,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
5687,Sheldon," Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
5688,Eliza,Do you notice I are using titanium anyone else ?
5689,Howard," Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering."
5690,Eliza,Your office that says you have a masters in engineering ?
5691,Sheldon," And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes."
5692,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5693,Howard, Sheldon.
5694,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your office that says you have a masters in engineering .
5695,Sheldon, Yes.
5696,Eliza,I see.
5697,Howard, Go away.
5698,Eliza,Please go on.
5699,Sheldon, Did Leonard tell you to say that?
5700,Eliza,"Oh, I to say that? ?"
5701,Howard," No, I thought of it all by myself."
5702,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
5703,Sheldon, Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.
5704,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be missing ?
5705,Raj, Go away.
5706,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5707,Sheldon, Curiouser and curiouser.
5708,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5709,Howard, Is he here?
5710,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5711,Leonard," If he were, I wouldn't be."
5712,Eliza,Do you think its likely that he was ?
5713,Raj," Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me."
5714,Eliza,Why do you think I know what he did you ?
5715,Leonard, Is that even possible?
5716,Eliza,Please go on.
5717,Raj," As it turns out, yes."
5718,Eliza,I understand.
5719,Howard," Something's got to be done about him, Leonard."
5720,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5721,Leonard, Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
5722,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5723,Raj," Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?"
5724,Eliza,Do you wish that something was to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon? ?
5725,Howard, Then our problem would be solved.
5726,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5727,Leonard," Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no."
5728,Eliza,Did you think they might not be we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? you are not saying no ?
5729,Howard," We don't have to go that far, there are other means available."
5730,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not other means available ?
5731,Raj, We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
5732,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
5733,Howard, The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
5734,Eliza,Please go on.
5735,Leonard," That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics."
5736,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5737,Howard, What about biology?
5738,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
5739,Leonard, What?
5740,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5741,Howard," You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind."
5742,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5743,Leonard," Howard, he's fifteen."
5744,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5745,Howard," Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8."
5746,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were fifteen you met Denise Polmerry and your grade point average fell from a 5 .
5747,Raj, She was sleeping with you?
5748,Eliza,Please go on.
5749,Howard," No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did."
5750,Eliza,In what way ?
5751,Sheldon," Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops.  Go away?  Hmm. Could it be me?"
5752,Eliza,What do you know about the three of I drop whatever it is I are working on and join you ?
5753,Penny," Oh, hey guys, what's up?"
5754,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5755,Howard, We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
5756,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5757,Penny, What?
5758,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5759,Leonard," Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick."
5760,Eliza,Please go on.
5761,Raj, It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
5762,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5763,Gablehouser," Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?"
5764,Eliza,What if they were not we interrupting? ?
5765,Sheldon," No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting."
5766,Eliza,Why not ?
5767,Gablehouser," Oh, what are you working on?"
5768,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
5769,Sheldon," Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert."
5770,Eliza,Why do you say your people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize ?
5771,Gablehouser, To what end?
5772,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
5773,Sheldon," You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come."
5774,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5775,Gablehouser, Who will come?
5776,Eliza,Earlier you said your people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize .
5777,Sheldon, The Jewish people.
5778,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5779,Gablehouser, What if they don't come.
5780,Eliza,"Really, if they don't come ?"
5781,Sheldon," We'll make it nice, put out a spread."
5782,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5783,Gablehouser," Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University."
5784,Eliza,Please go on.
5785,Sheldon," Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you."
5786,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5787,Gablehouser," Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of... um... he's nuts."
5788,Eliza,What makes you think I am very busy with my ?
5789,Sheldon," Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize..."
5790,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5791,Sheldon," I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
5792,Eliza,Do you say you really don't understand my objections for some special reason ?
5793,Goldfarb, Go away.
5794,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5795,Sheldon, We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
5796,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5797,Goldfarb, Please go away.
5798,Eliza,Please go on.
5799,Sheldon, Said Pharoah to Moses.
5800,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5801,Gablehouser, Why are all these young women here?
5802,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5803,Leonard, It's take your daughter to work day.
5804,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my daughter to work day ?
5805,Gablehouser," Really, I was not aware of that."
5806,Eliza,Were you really ?
5807,Raj," Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16."
5808,Eliza,"Realy, everyone ?"
5809,Gablehouser, Hm?
5810,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5811,Howard, Smooth.
5812,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5813,Raj, Thank you.
5814,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
5815,Gablehouser, There's the man of the hour.
5816,Eliza,Please go on.
5817,Leonard," Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women."
5818,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5819,Howard, All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.
5820,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5821,Leonard, Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
5822,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5823,Raj, We need a social catalyst.
5824,Eliza,Please go on.
5825,Leonard, Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
5826,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5827,Howard, Or can we?
5828,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5829,Leonard," No, we can't."
5830,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5831,Howard, I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.
5832,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5833,Sheldon," Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me."
5834,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
5835,Leonard," Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis."
5836,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5837,Raj, Okay. How about that one.
5838,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5839,Howard," Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
5840,Eliza,Do you think its likely that ?
5841,Raj, Are you crying?
5842,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am crying? or not ?
5843,Howard," No, I have allergies."
5844,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
5845,Raj," Okay, uh, how about her?"
5846,Eliza,What do you think ?
5847,Leonard," Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you."
5848,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
5849,Raj," Okay, so not her either. How about her?"
5850,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
5851,Howard," Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem."
5852,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5853,Leonard, I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
5854,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5855,Raj," I can't talk to her, you do it."
5856,Eliza,Perhaps you could talk to her now.
5857,Leonard," I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her."
5858,Eliza,Do you really want to be able to just go up and talk to her ?
5859,Howard," Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this."
5860,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
5861,Raj," You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done."
5862,Eliza,Do you wish that we was in India this would be simpler ?
5863,Leonard," Well, we're not in India."
5864,Eliza,Please go on.
5865,Raj," Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
5866,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
5867,Leonard," Okay, that was uncalled for."
5868,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5869,Raj," You started it, dude."
5870,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
5871,Gablehouser, Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
5872,Eliza,You say Could you have everyone's attention please ?
5873,Sheldon, Welcome Dennis Kim.
5874,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5875,Gablehouser," Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award."
5876,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5877,Sheldon, Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
5878,Eliza,Please go on.
5879,Gablehouser," And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!"
5880,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5881,Dennis, What?
5882,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5883,Gablehouser, Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
5884,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
5885,Dennis," Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma."
5886,Eliza,Why not ?
5887,Gablehouser," Well, uh, well, uh...."
5888,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5889,Leonard, The kid got a girl.
5890,Eliza,Please go on.
5891,Raj, Unbelievable.
5892,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5893,Howard, Did anyone see how he did it?
5894,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
5895,Sheldon," Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you."
5896,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
5897,Howard, He's back.
5898,Eliza,But your research will go on uninterrupted .
5899,Leonard," Yeah, mission accomplished."
5900,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5901,Raj," Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
5902,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
5903,Howard, I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.
5904,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
5905,Leonard," Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart."
5906,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
5907,Raj, Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting.
5908,Eliza,Don't you know ?
5909,Howard," Yeah, let's go with that."
5910,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5911,Howard," Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park."
5912,Eliza,Do you say Unbelievable for some special reason ?
5913,Leonard," I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”"
5914,Eliza,What do you know about the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for I telling the policewoman “you have to frisk you ?
5915,Raj," Hey, look at that.  It's Dennis Kim."
5916,Eliza,Please go on.
5917,Howard," Wow, I almost didn't recognise him."
5918,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
5919,Raj," You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him."
5920,Eliza,"Oh, I know ?"
5921,Leonard," Yeah, we really ruined his life."
5922,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5923,Sheldon," Screw him, he was weak."
5924,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5925,Howard," Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth."
5926,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5927,Raj, I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
5928,Eliza,Please go on.
5929,Sheldon," Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter."
5930,Eliza,"Really, if I will ?"
5931,Leonard," Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive."
5932,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5933,Howard, Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
5934,Eliza,You don't seem quite certain.
5935,Raj," How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose."
5936,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
5937,Penny," Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going “aaaaaaa”."
5938,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were writing an email and the A key got stuck now ?
5939,Leonard, What did you spill on it?
5940,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
5941,Penny, Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
5942,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5943,Leonard, I'll take a look at it.
5944,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5945,Howard," Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year."
5946,Eliza,Please go on.
5947,Leonard," You're kidding, why not?"
5948,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am kidding ?
5949,Howard," They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm."
5950,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5951,Penny," Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys."
5952,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
5953,Howard, Recognise.
5954,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5955,Leonard," This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod."
5956,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5957,Penny, Zod?
5958,Eliza,Please go on.
5959,Howard, Kryptonian villain. Long story.
5960,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5961,Raj, Good story.
5962,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5963,Sheldon, Well count me out.
5964,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5965,Howard, What? Why?
5966,Eliza,Please go on.
5967,Sheldon, You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
5968,Eliza,Is it important that your intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would I ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would I ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would I ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? ?
5969,Leonard," Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people."
5970,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
5971,Sheldon," By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."
5972,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would I ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would I ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would I ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? ?
5973,Penny, I want tickets to that please.
5974,Eliza,What if you never got tickets to that please ?
5975,Leonard," Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you."
5976,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
5977,Sheldon," No, don't."
5978,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
5979,Leonard, The needs of the many.
5980,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5981,Howard, Outweigh the needs of the few.
5982,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5983,Sheldon," Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it."
5984,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
5985,Raj, Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
5986,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
5987,Howard," How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies."
5988,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
5989,Leonard, The ladies?
5990,Eliza,Please go on.
5991,Howard," Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
5992,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
5993,Raj, I like it.
5994,Eliza,You say you like it ?
5995,Sheldon," I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
5996,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to ?
5997,Raj, Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
5998,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
5999,Sheldon," Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant."
6000,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
6001,Raj, Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
6002,Eliza,Why the uncertain tone ?
6003,Leonard, Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour....
6004,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6005,Sheldon," Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant."
6006,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6007,Leonard, Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
6008,Eliza,Please go on.
6009,Sheldon, I will yield.
6010,Eliza,Do you say you will yield for some special reason ?
6011,Leonard," After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
6012,Eliza,Do you think its likely that he does not get his way? ?
6013,Sheldon, He does.
6014,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6015,Leonard," I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
6016,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6017,Penny," Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?"
6018,Eliza,Do you enjoy being Penny ?
6019,Leonard, Yes.
6020,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
6021,Sheldon, Of course.
6022,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6023,Howard, Fire away.
6024,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6025,Penny," You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
6026,Eliza,Your business ?
6027,Leonard," Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice."
6028,Eliza,Possibly they are mixed into the crowd .
6029,Penny," Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil."
6030,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your business .
6031,Leonard," I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start."
6032,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were actually the one who noticed .
6033,Penny," Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper."
6034,Eliza,What do you think ?
6035,Sheldon," And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
6036,Eliza,Please go on.
6037,Penny, That is correct.
6038,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6039,Leonard, I knew that too.
6040,Eliza,You say you knew that too ?
6041,Penny," Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard."
6042,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6043,Sheldon," And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
6044,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6045,Penny, Right.
6046,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6047,Howard," Hey, I buzzed in."
6048,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6049,Sheldon," But I answered, it's called teamwork."
6050,Eliza,Do you say But you answered for some special reason ?
6051,Howard, Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
6052,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6053,Sheldon, By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
6054,Eliza,Is it because you are a mammal that you came to me ?
6055,Leonard, Just ask another one.
6056,Eliza,Please go on.
6057,Penny, Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?
6058,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
6059,Sheldon, And of course it's Gravity Probe B.
6060,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6061,Leonard," Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer."
6062,Eliza,"Oh, I have to let somebody else answer ?"
6063,Sheldon, Why?
6064,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6065,Penny, Because it's polite.
6066,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
6067,Sheldon, What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
6068,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
6069,Penny," Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions."
6070,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6071,Sheldon," The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them?"
6072,Eliza,Do you wish that you know them ?
6073,Howard, Some of us might have the correct answers too.
6074,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6075,Sheldon," Oh please, you don't even have a PhD."
6076,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6077,Howard," Alright, that's it."
6078,Eliza,Please go on.
6079,Leonard," Howard, sit down."
6080,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6081,Howard, Okay.
6082,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6083,Leonard, maybe we should take a little break.
6084,Eliza,Can't you be more positive ?
6085,Sheldon," Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury."
6086,Eliza,Why do you say your old Nintendo injury ?
6087,Howard, I agree.
6088,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6089,Penny, What did he say?
6090,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
6091,Howard, He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
6092,Eliza,Earlier you said your old Nintendo injury .
6093,Penny," Yeah, and the bag it came in."
6094,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6095,Sheldon," Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
6096,Eliza,What would getting to show I something mean to you ?
6097,Leonard," Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
6098,Eliza,What does wanting to talk to I have to do with this discussion ?
6099,Sheldon," Just look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold."
6100,Eliza,Did you think they might not be based on Star Trek ?
6101,Leonard, Why do they say AA?
6102,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
6103,Sheldon, Army Ants.
6104,Eliza,Please go on.
6105,Leonard, Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
6106,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6107,Sheldon, Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
6108,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
6109,Leonard," No, I meant.... never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
6110,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
6111,Sheldon," Oh neat, what's the occasion?"
6112,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6113,Leonard," Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team."
6114,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
6115,Sheldon, What?
6116,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6117,Leonard," Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting."
6118,Eliza,You say Howard ?
6119,Sheldon, No you didn't.
6120,Eliza,Why not ?
6121,Leonard," Yes we did, I just came from it."
6122,Eliza,You are sure.
6123,Sheldon," Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet."
6124,Eliza,How long have you been on the team and you wasn't there ?
6125,Leonard," Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team."
6126,Eliza,Were you really ?
6127,Sheldon, Why?
6128,Eliza,Please go on.
6129,Leonard, Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
6130,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
6131,Sheldon," Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
6132,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be sorry ?
6133,Leonard," Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more."
6134,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were annoying and no-one wants to play with I any more ?
6135,Sheldon," I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
6136,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6137,Leonard, Thanks for the heads up.
6138,Eliza,But your own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind my very matter together .
6139,Sheldon, You're welcome. One more thing.
6140,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be welcome .
6141,Leonard, Yes.
6142,Eliza,I see.
6143,Sheldon," It's on, bitch."
6144,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6145,Howard, So who'd he get to be on his team.
6146,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6147,Leonard," He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar."
6148,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6149,Raj," He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you."
6150,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we say we wait until he looks at us each other.
6151,Leonard, How exactly would that laugh go?
6152,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
6153,Raj, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
6154,Eliza,Please go on.
6155,Howard," That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians."
6156,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of my Dalmatians ?
6157,Leonard," Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
6158,Eliza,Is it important that your room mate ?
6159,Howard, So?
6160,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your room mate ?
6161,Leonard," So nothing, let's destroy him."
6162,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6163,Sheldon, Gentlemen.
6164,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6165,Raj, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
6166,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6167,Howard," Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team."
6168,Eliza,Please go on.
6169,Raj," You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something."
6170,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6171,Leonard," Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team."
6172,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6173,Raj, How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
6174,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
6175,Howard," Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems."
6176,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6177,Leonard, We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
6178,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6179,Raj, Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?
6180,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
6181,Leonard, Yes.
6182,Eliza,I understand.
6183,Howard, Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
6184,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6185,Raj," Yeah. Sack up, dude."
6186,Eliza,Please go on.
6187,Leonard," Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
6188,Eliza,Do you say Fine for some special reason ?
6189,Leslie, Hi guys.
6190,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6191,Leonard," Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I..."
6192,Eliza,Do you wish to have a question for I me ?
6193,Howard, Hit that thang.
6194,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6195,Leslie," Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus."
6196,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
6197,Leonard," There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be."
6198,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6199,Leslie," Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom."
6200,Eliza,What about your own performance ?
6201,Leonard," That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now."
6202,Eliza,What do you know about it's okay ?
6203,Leslie, Proceed.
6204,Eliza,Please go on.
6205,Leonard, We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
6206,Eliza,What if they were not entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team ?
6207,Leslie," No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search."
6208,Eliza,How ?
6209,Howard," Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you."
6210,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
6211,Leslie, Sorry.
6212,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
6213,Howard," Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano."
6214,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6215,Leslie," Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?"
6216,Eliza,What makes you think I am going up against Sheldon Cooper? ?
6217,Howard, Yes.
6218,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
6219,Leslie," That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?"
6220,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
6221,Leonard, She's in.
6222,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing? .
6223,Penny," So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?"
6224,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
6225,Leonard," Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing."
6226,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6227,Penny," Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting."
6228,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
6229,Sheldon, Gentlemen.
6230,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6231,Leonard, Sheldon.
6232,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6233,Howard, Sheldon.
6234,Eliza,Please go on.
6235,Raj, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
6236,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6237,Penny, Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.
6238,Eliza,Do you enjoy being just going to sit down ?
6239,Leonard," So, is that your team."
6240,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's team ?
6241,Sheldon," Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
6242,Eliza,Your Spanish is not good ?
6243,Leslie," Hello, Sheldon."
6244,Eliza,Hi. What seems to be your problem ?
6245,Sheldon, Leslie Winkle?
6246,Eliza,Earlier you said your Spanish is not good .
6247,Leslie," Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?"
6248,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6249,Sheldon," Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you."
6250,Eliza,Why do you say your direction is reflected off of you ?
6251,Leslie," Oh, ouch."
6252,Eliza,But your direction is reflected off of you .
6253,Dr Gablehouser," Okay, if everyone could please take your seats."
6254,Eliza,"Really, if everyone could please take my seats ?"
6255,Leonard, Here's your tee-shirt.
6256,Eliza,"Really, my tee-shirt ?"
6257,Leslie," PMS? It's a couple of days early, but..."
6258,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6259,Leonard," No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad."
6260,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
6261,Leslie," Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?"
6262,Eliza,Do you think you were thinking? ?
6263,Gablehouser," Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year's physics bowl. Today's preliminary match features two great teams... AA versus PMS."
6264,Eliza,Surely not everyone .
6265,Howard," All night long, y'all!"
6266,Eliza,Please go on.
6267,Gablehouser," Okay, well let's jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson?  PMS?"
6268,Eliza,What do you think ?
6269,Leonard, The Eta Meson.
6270,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6271,Gablehouser, Correct.
6272,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6273,Sheldon, Formal protest.
6274,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6275,Gablehouser, On what grounds?
6276,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
6277,Sheldon, The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
6278,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6279,Gablehouser," Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope.  AA?"
6280,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
6281,Sheldon," And of course, the answer is Technetium."
6282,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your shirt ?
6283,Gablehouser," Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation.  PMS?"
6284,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
6285,Raj," Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect."
6286,Eliza,Please go on.
6287,Gablehouser, Correct.
6288,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6289,Gablehouser, How does a quantum computer factor large numbers.  PMS?
6290,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
6291,Leslie, Shor's Algorithm.
6292,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6293,Gablehouser, Correct.
6294,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6295,Sheldon, 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
6296,Eliza,Please go on.
6297,Leonard, Prevost's theory of exchanges.
6298,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6299,Sheldon, Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
6300,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6301,Howard," 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
6302,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6303,Gablehouser," Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning."
6304,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my second warning ?
6305,Sheldon, A sigma particle.
6306,Eliza,Please go on.
6307,Leslie," Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth."
6308,Eliza,You are sure.
6309,Gablehouser," Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation."
6310,Eliza,Is it important that your hand the final question ?
6311,Raj, Holy crap.
6312,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your hand the final question .
6313,Leonard, What the hell is that.
6314,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
6315,Howard, It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
6316,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6317,Leonard," Come on, think, Leslie."
6318,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6319,Leslie," Leonard, it's not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there."
6320,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I rush you ?
6321,Leonard," You're never going to let that go, are you?"
6322,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am never going to let that go ?
6323,Gablehouser, Ten seconds.  PMS.
6324,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6325,Leonard," Sorry, I panicked."
6326,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
6327,Howard, Then guess.
6328,Eliza,Please go on.
6329,Leonard," Um, eight.  Point four."
6330,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6331,Gablehouser," I'm sorry, that's incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours."
6332,Eliza,Do you wish that I can answer correctly ?
6333,Howard, He doesn't have it. He's got squat.
6334,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6335,Gablehouser," AA, I need your answer."
6336,Eliza,What would it mean to you if you got my answer ?
6337,Third Floor Janitor, The answer is minus eight by alpha.
6338,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6339,Sheldon," Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?"
6340,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
6341,Third Floor Janitor, Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
6342,Eliza,Please go on.
6343,Sheldon, How do you know anything about physics?
6344,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
6345,Third Floor Janitor," Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears."
6346,Eliza,Is it because you are physicist that you came to me ?
6347,Sheldon," Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
6348,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6349,Third Floor Janitor, You didn't answer question.
6350,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6351,Sheldon," Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!"
6352,Eliza,You aren't sure ?
6353,Gablehouser," AA, I need your official answer."
6354,Eliza,Why do you want my official answer ?
6355,Sheldon, Well it's not what he said.
6356,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
6357,Gablehouser, Then what is it?
6358,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
6359,Sheldon, I want a different question.
6360,Eliza,Suppose you got a different question soon ?
6361,Gablehouser, You can't have a different question.
6362,Eliza,"Oh, I can't have a different question ?"
6363,Sheldon, Formal protest.
6364,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6365,Gablehouser, Denied.
6366,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6367,Sheldon, Informal protest.
6368,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6369,Gablehouser, Denied. I need your official answer.
6370,Eliza,What if you never got my official answer ?
6371,Sheldon, No. I decline to provide one.
6372,Eliza,Why not ?
6373,Gablehouser," Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct."
6374,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
6375,Sheldon, That's your opinion.
6376,Eliza,What about your own opinion ?
6377,Gablehouser," Alright, the winner of the match is..."
6378,Eliza,Please go on.
6379,Leonard," Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team."
6380,Eliza,Can you think of anyone in particular ?
6381,Sheldon, I don't understand the question.
6382,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
6383,Leonard, Go ahead.
6384,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6385,Gablehouser, The winner is PMS!
6386,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6387,Leonard," Sorry, somebody's sitting there."
6388,Eliza,Apologies are not necessary.
6389,Sheldon, Who?
6390,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6391,Leonard, My Physics Bowl Trophy!
6392,Eliza,Your Physics Bowl Trophy! ?
6393,Sheldon," That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win."
6394,Eliza,You seem to need to forfeited me.
6395,Leonard, I know someone who would disagree.
6396,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6397,Sheldon, Who?
6398,Eliza,Earlier you said your Physics Bowl Trophy! .
6399,Leonard," My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”"
6400,Eliza,Why do you say your Physics Bowl Trophy! “Leonard is so smart ?
6401,Sheldon, Alright that is very immature.
6402,Eliza,But your Physics Bowl Trophy! “Leonard is so smart .
6403,Leonard," You're right, I'm sorry.  I'm not!"
6404,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were right ?
6405,Penny," Okay, new contest."
6406,Eliza,Please go on.
6407,Leonard, What are you doing?
6408,Eliza,What do you think ?
6409,Penny," I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?"
6410,Eliza,How long have you been settling once and for all who is the smartest around here ?
6411,Sheldon, Absolutely.
6412,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6413,Leonard, Bring it on.
6414,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6415,Penny," Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
6416,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
6417,Sheldon, The Brady Bunch?
6418,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6419,Penny," Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God, Sean Penn!"
6420,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6421,Leonard, How do you know these things?
6422,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
6423,Penny," I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?"
6424,Eliza,You say you go outside and you talk to people ?
6425,Sheldon, William Shatner.
6426,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your God ?
6427,Leonard," Wait, I don't think it's Shatner."
6428,Eliza,Don't you really think it's Shatner ?
6429,Sheldon, Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.
6430,Eliza,Please go on.
6431,Penny, No.
6432,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
6433,Sheldon, Formal protest.
6434,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6435,Penny," Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?"
6436,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6437,Sheldon, Romulan.
6438,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6439,Penny, Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
6440,Eliza,I see.
6441,Sheldon," Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
6442,Eliza,Do you say Well for some special reason ?
6443,Raj, What did they give you?
6444,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
6445,Sheldon, Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
6446,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6447,Leonard, I don't believe it.
6448,Eliza,Why don't you believe it ?
6449,Sheldon," I know, it's basic culinary science."
6450,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6451,Leonard, Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
6452,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
6453,Howard, A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?
6454,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
6455,Leonard," No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice."
6456,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
6457,Raj," Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough."
6458,Eliza,What do you think about machines ?
6459,Howard," Oh, that's cool."
6460,Eliza,Please go on.
6461,Leonard, Uh-huh.
6462,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6463,Raj, It's only $800?
6464,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6465,Leonard, Yeah. And that's my bid.
6466,Eliza,Is it important that your bid ?
6467,Sheldon, You bid $800.
6468,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6469,Leonard," It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it."
6470,Eliza,You say It was a spur of the moment thing ?
6471,Sheldon, There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
6472,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your bid .
6473,Howard, Do you have $800?
6474,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6475,Leonard, Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
6476,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
6477,Howard," Don't worry, the way these things work there's people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it's called sniping."
6478,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6479,Raj, Fifteen seconds.
6480,Eliza,Please go on.
6481,Leonard," Come on, snipers."
6482,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6483,Raj," Ten, nine, eight..."
6484,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6485,Leonard, Where are your snipers?
6486,Eliza,Possibly they are my snipers? .
6487,Raj, Five.
6488,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6489,Leonard, Snipe.
6490,Eliza,Please go on.
6491,Raj, Four.
6492,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6493,Leonard, Snipe.
6494,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6495,Raj, Three.
6496,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6497,Leonard, Snipe!
6498,Eliza,Please go on.
6499,Raj, Two.
6500,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6501,Leonard, SNIPE!
6502,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6503,Raj, One.
6504,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6505,Leonard, Aaaa-aw!
6506,Eliza,Please go on.
6507,Raj," Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
6508,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
6509,Howard, You lucky duck.
6510,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6511,Sheldon," I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia."
6512,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6513,Leonard," Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it."
6514,Eliza,Do you say Yeah for some special reason ?
6515,Howard, Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
6516,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
6517,Raj, A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?
6518,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be in ?
6519,Sheldon, Need you ask? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid.
6520,Eliza,"Oh, I ask? But you still don't understand why no-one else bid ?"
6521,Sheldon, I understand why no-one else bid.
6522,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6523,Raj, Did the listing actually say miniature?
6524,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6525,Leonard, I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
6526,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
6527,Sheldon," In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
6528,Eliza,Your time machine” and “need $800” ?
6529,Howard," It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound."
6530,Eliza,Earlier you said your time machine” and “need $800” .
6531,Raj, Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
6532,Eliza,Did you think they might not be $12 ?
6533,Leonard, How are we going to get it upstairs?
6534,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
6535,Howard, If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
6536,Eliza,What do you know about we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator ?
6537,Leonard, Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years.
6538,Eliza,I understand.
6539,Sheldon," I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?"
6540,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6541,Howard," Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby's broken."
6542,Eliza,You say Not necessary ?
6543,Leonard," Come on, guys, push."
6544,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6545,Howard, If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
6546,Eliza,"Really, if you push any harder you are going to give birth to your colon ?"
6547,Raj," I can't feel my fingers, hurry up."
6548,Eliza,Why do you say your fingers ?
6549,Sheldon," It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
6550,Eliza,In what way ?
6551,Raj, Sheldon?
6552,Eliza,But your fingers .
6553,Sheldon, Yeah.
6554,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6555,Raj," If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one."
6556,Eliza,Do you think its likely that your fingers ever work again ?
6557,Penny," Oh, hey guys."
6558,Eliza,Please go on.
6559,Leonard," Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!"
6560,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6561,Penny, What are you doing?
6562,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
6563,Leonard," Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs."
6564,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6565,Penny, What is it?
6566,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
6567,Leonard," It's... you know, time machine."
6568,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
6569,Penny," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...."
6570,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6571,Leonard," Uh, just give us a few minutes."
6572,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6573,Penny," I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late."
6574,Eliza,Do you enjoy being running really late ?
6575,Sheldon," Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell."
6576,Eliza,Do you wish that I are subject to vertigo ?
6577,Penny," You're joking, right?"
6578,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be joking .
6579,Sheldon," Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo."
6580,Eliza,Do you say Oh for some special reason ?
6581,Penny," Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof."
6582,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6583,Leonard," Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not... never mind."
6584,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
6585,Sheldon," For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous."
6586,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
6587,Leonard," Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
6588,Eliza,Please go on.
6589,Raj, In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
6590,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6591,Sheldon, I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
6592,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to know what I was worried about ?
6593,Leonard, Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
6594,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6595,Sheldon," The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy."
6596,Eliza,What do you think about machines ?
6597,Howard, Talk about your chick magnets.
6598,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's chick magnets ?
6599,Raj," Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!"
6600,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
6601,Sheldon," Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here."
6602,Eliza,You say Gentlemen ?
6603,Howard," You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,” how lame is that?"
6604,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
6605,Raj, He's got a point.
6606,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6607,Sheldon," Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine."
6608,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
6609,Leonard, Seconded.
6610,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6611,Howard, I was going to put down a towel.
6612,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were going to put down a towel now ?
6613,Raj, I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
6614,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6615,Leonard, That sounds fair.
6616,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your balcony ?
6617,Sheldon," Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?"
6618,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6619,Raj, Twice a month.
6620,Eliza,Please go on.
6621,Sheldon, Then no.
6622,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
6623,Raj," Okay, every other month."
6624,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6625,Sheldon, No.
6626,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
6627,Leonard," Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876."
6628,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
6629,Howard," Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson."
6630,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6631,Sheldon," Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too."
6632,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6633,Leonard," So, when it's your turn you can."
6634,Eliza,What do you think ?
6635,Sheldon," But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up."
6636,Eliza,What resemblence do you see ?
6637,Raj," Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena."
6638,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
6639,Howard," And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”"
6640,Eliza,What do you know about I can make it to Boston ?
6641,Raj," Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock."
6642,Eliza,"Oh, I knock ?"
6643,Sheldon," Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
6644,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6645,Raj," Ooh, how far into the future?"
6646,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
6647,Sheldon," If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
6648,Eliza,Why do you recollect correctly just now ?
6649,Leonard," Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun."
6650,Eliza,Is it because you are setting the dials for January 10th that you came to me ?
6651,Raj, My turn.
6652,Eliza,Is it important that your turn ?
6653,Penny," Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee."
6654,Eliza,Your knee ?
6655,Leonard, Are you okay?
6656,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't okay? ?
6657,Penny," Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch."
6658,Eliza,Do you say Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all for some special reason ?
6659,Leonard, That doesn't sound too bad.
6660,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your turn .
6661,Penny," It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."
6662,Eliza,Earlier you said your knee .
6663,Leonard, Sorry.
6664,Eliza,I've told you that apologies are not required.
6665,Penny," Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this..."
6666,Eliza,Why do you say your shift away ?
6667,Sheldon, Time machine.
6668,Eliza,What do you think about machines ?
6669,Leonard," The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
6670,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6671,Penny," No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that..."
6672,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6673,Sheldon," Again, time machine."
6674,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
6675,Penny," Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades."
6676,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
6677,Sheldon, It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
6678,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your God ?
6679,Penny," Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic."
6680,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6681,Raj, My turn!
6682,Eliza,Is it important that your turn! ?
6683,Sheldon," Leonard, it's two in the morning."
6684,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your turn! .
6685,Leonard, So?
6686,Eliza,But your shift away .
6687,Sheldon, So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
6688,Eliza,Your turn ?
6689,Leonard, Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
6690,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
6691,Sheldon," You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake."
6692,Eliza,"Really, if I was to prevent myself from buying it in the past ?"
6693,Leonard, Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
6694,Eliza,Whether or not you can go back and prevent I from explaining that to me? depends on you more than me.
6695,Sheldon," Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious."
6696,Eliza,What does that similarity suggest to you ?
6697,Leonard, What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
6698,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you knocked I unconscious right now? ?
6699,Sheldon, It won't change the past.
6700,Eliza,Earlier you said your turn .
6701,Leonard, But it would make the present so much nicer.
6702,Eliza,Please go on.
6703,Sheldon, Are you upset about something?
6704,Eliza,Perhaps I am upset about something? in your fantasies.
6705,Leonard, What was your first clue?
6706,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
6707,Sheldon," Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability..."
6708,Eliza,"Really, my irritability ?"
6709,Leonard, Yes I'm upset.
6710,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
6711,Sheldon, Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
6712,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
6713,Leonard," Yeah, good for you."
6714,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6715,Sheldon," Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?"
6716,Eliza,"Oh, I want to talk about what's bothering you? ?"
6717,Leonard, I don't know. Maybe.
6718,Eliza,Don't you really know ?
6719,Sheldon," Wow, I'm on fire tonight."
6720,Eliza,How long have you been on fire tonight ?
6721,Leonard," Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines."
6722,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6723,Sheldon, I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
6724,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
6725,Leonard, Thanks for pointing it out.
6726,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6727,Sheldon," In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."
6728,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
6729,Leonard, Those are movies.
6730,Eliza,Would you like it if they were not movies ?
6731,Sheldon, Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.
6732,Eliza,What if I had been expecting you to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd ?
6733,Leonard," Come on, guys, push."
6734,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6735,Howard, If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
6736,Eliza,Do you wish that you push any harder you are going to give birth to your colon ?
6737,Penny," Oh, hey guys."
6738,Eliza,Please go on.
6739,Leonard," Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!"
6740,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6741,Penny, What are you doing?
6742,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
6743,Leonard," Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine."
6744,Eliza,What do you think about machines ?
6745,Penny," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...."
6746,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6747,Leonard, No problem.  Hang on.
6748,Eliza,Why not ?
6749,Penny," But, what about your time machine."
6750,Eliza,Do computers worry you ?
6751,Leonard, Some things are more important than toys.
6752,Eliza,What if they were not more important than toys ?
6753,Penny," Oh, I'm scared."
6754,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be scared ?
6755,Leonard," Don't worry baby, I've got you."
6756,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6757,Penny," Oh, Leonard."
6758,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6759,Sheldon, It's still my turn.
6760,Eliza,Why do you say your turn ?
6761,Sheldon, What are you doing?
6762,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
6763,Leonard, I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
6764,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6765,Sheldon, Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
6766,Eliza,What do you know about I need money I can always sell blood ?
6767,Leonard, It's not about money.
6768,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell ?
6769,Raj, We brought food.
6770,Eliza,But your turn .
6771,Howard," Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
6772,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6773,Leonard," Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
6774,Eliza,Is it important that your share of the time machine? ?
6775,Raj, Why?
6776,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your share of the time machine? .
6777,Leonard, Because I don't want it any more.
6778,Eliza,What other reasons might there be ?
6779,Howard, Why?
6780,Eliza,Please go on.
6781,Leonard, Just... personal reasons.
6782,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6783,Sheldon, My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
6784,Eliza,Your spidey-sense tells you this has something to do with Penny ?
6785,Leonard," Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
6786,Eliza,You like to think I want to buy you -- don't you ?
6787,Raj," I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony."
6788,Eliza,Why do you say your balcony ?
6789,Howard," Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage."
6790,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6791,Leonard, I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
6792,Eliza,Is it important that your share ?
6793,Raj," Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
6794,Eliza,Why do you mention computers ?
6795,Sheldon," I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is."
6796,Eliza,What do you think machines have to do with your problem ?
6797,Raj," Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects."
6798,Eliza,Your original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects ?
6799,Leonard," No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it."
6800,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
6801,Howard," You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana."
6802,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6803,Raj," More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?"
6804,Eliza,But your balcony .
6805,Leonard, Not for long.
6806,Eliza,Earlier you said your spidey-sense tells you this has something to do with Penny .
6807,Raj," Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."
6808,Eliza,You say Oh ?
6809,Howard," Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection."
6810,Eliza,Why do you say your Justice Society of America collection ?
6811,Raj," Too bad, I called dibs."
6812,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6813,Howard, Well you can't just call dibs.
6814,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6815,Raj," I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia."
6816,Eliza,Do you say you can and you did for some special reason ?
6817,Sheldon, Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.
6818,Eliza,Earlier you said your original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects .
6819,Leonard," It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store."
6820,Eliza,Do you enjoy being selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store ?
6821,Raj, Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
6822,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
6823,Howard, Will you forget dibs!
6824,Eliza,"Oh, I forget dibs! ?"
6825,Leonard, He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
6826,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your share .
6827,Sheldon," What's the number, I'll match it."
6828,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your garage ?
6829,Raj," I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees."
6830,Eliza,But your Justice Society of America collection .
6831,Sheldon, What's the exchange rate.
6832,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6833,Raj, None of your business. Take it or leave it.
6834,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my business ?
6835,Howard," Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel."
6836,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6837,Leonard," Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
6838,Eliza,"Really, if you sell to one of I ?"
6839,Sheldon," Who cares, as long as you pick me."
6840,Eliza,What makes you think I pick you ?
6841,Raj," Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk."
6842,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your bar-mizvah bonds ?
6843,Leonard," Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
6844,Eliza,Is it important that your mind is made up ?
6845,Sheldon, No. I can't let you do this.
6846,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
6847,Leonard," Sheldon, get out of my way."
6848,Eliza,Your way ?
6849,Sheldon, None shall pass.
6850,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your mind is made up .
6851,Howard," Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here."
6852,Eliza,Earlier you said your way .
6853,Penny, What the hell's going on?
6854,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
6855,Sheldon, You hypocrite!
6856,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6857,Penny, What?
6858,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6859,Sheldon," Little Miss “grown ups don't play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!"
6860,Eliza,Do you think its likely that you was to go into that apartment right now ?
6861,Penny," Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset."
6862,Eliza,Do you wish that this is about yesterday ?
6863,Leonard," No, I needed to hear it."
6864,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
6865,Penny," No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are."
6866,Eliza,Why not ?
6867,Howard, I guess that makes me large breasts.
6868,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
6869,Leonard," Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life."
6870,Eliza,Why do you say your life ?
6871,Penny, Really?
6872,Eliza,But your life .
6873,Leonard, Yeah.
6874,Eliza,Please go on.
6875,Penny, Oh. Wow. Good for you.
6876,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6877,Leonard," Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later..."
6878,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6879,Good looking man coming up stairs," Excuse me. Hey, Penny!"
6880,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6881,Penny, Hi Mike.
6882,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6883,Mike, Are you ready to go.
6884,Eliza,Do you sometimes think I am ready to go ?
6885,Penny," Yeah, I just have to change."
6886,Eliza,You say Yeah ?
6887,Mike, I'll give you a hand.
6888,Eliza,"Oh, I a hand ?"
6889,Penny," Oh, stop it! Bye guys."
6890,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6891,Leonard, My turn on the time machine.
6892,Eliza,Don't you think computers can help people ?
6893,Sheldon," It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.  Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp!"
6894,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were mad .
6895,Leonard," Sheldon, are you okay?"
6896,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
6897,Sheldon, We have to get rid of the time machine.
6898,Eliza,What about machines worrys you ?
6899,Leonard," It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?"
6900,Eliza,Please go on.
6901,Sheldon," Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big."
6902,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6903,Leonard," I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas."
6904,Eliza,Can you explan why you are suddenly glad ?
6905,Sheldon," Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh."
6906,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
6907,Leonard," On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it."
6908,Eliza,What do you know about the super collider actually works ?
6909,Raj," Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man."
6910,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
6911,Leonard," Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
6912,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6913,Raj," We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?"
6914,Eliza,Possibly they are testing a new medication for social anxiety .
6915,Leonard," I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.  What's going on?"
6916,Eliza,Why don't you know ?
6917,Howard, Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.
6918,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6919,Leonard, Sheldon's office? Is she lost?
6920,Eliza,Please go on.
6921,Howard, Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
6922,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
6923,Leonard, Maybe she's his lawyer.
6924,Eliza,Don't you know ?
6925,Howard, Well she's free to examine my briefs.
6926,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
6927,Leonard, Howard...
6928,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your briefs ?
6929,Howard," I know, I'm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again."
6930,Eliza,Is it because you are disgusting that you came to me ?
6931,Girl," Well, that should do it."
6932,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6933,Sheldon, Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
6934,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
6935,Leonard," Oh, hey buddy."
6936,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
6937,Sheldon, Buddy.
6938,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
6939,Howard," Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
6940,Eliza,Please don't apologise.
6941,Sheldon," How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all."
6942,Eliza,What do you think ?
6943,Howard," Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and... BAM!  Howard Wolowitz."
6944,Eliza,"Who, for example?"
6945,Leonard," Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?"
6946,Eliza,Why are you interested in whether I am going to introduce us? or not ?
6947,Sheldon," Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard."
6948,Eliza,Please go on.
6949,Missy, It's nice to meet you.
6950,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
6951,Leonard," You too, swell, also."
6952,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
6953,Howard, Yeah.
6954,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
6955,Leonard," So, how do you two know each other."
6956,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
6957,Missy," Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head."
6958,Eliza,Is it important that your legs wrapped around his head ?
6959,Leonard, Excuse me?
6960,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your legs wrapped around his head .
6961,Sheldon," She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it."
6962,Eliza,Who else in your family ?
6963,Missy," It's because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly."
6964,Eliza,Is that the real reason ?
6965,Sheldon, How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?
6966,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
6967,Howard," Well, I think you're delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole."
6968,Eliza,What makes you think I am delightfully droll ?
6969,Missy," Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and... I'm sorry what was your name again."
6970,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
6971,Sheldon, Rajesh.
6972,Eliza,Earlier you said your twin sister .
6973,Leonard," So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?"
6974,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
6975,Howard," Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny."
6976,Eliza,You don't seem quite certain.
6977,Missy, My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
6978,Eliza,Your friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night ?
6979,Howard," Destiny, thy name is Anaheim."
6980,Eliza,"I've told you before, I don't care about names -- please continue."
6981,Missy, And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
6982,Eliza,Why do you say your dad's estate ?
6983,Sheldon," The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she."
6984,Eliza,"Really, I here to spy on you ?"
6985,Missy, I guess that's why they call you a genius.
6986,Eliza,Do you guess that's why they call anyone else ?
6987,Sheldon," They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
6988,Eliza,Don't any other reasons come to mind ?
6989,Leonard and Howard together," Woah, woah."
6990,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your dad's estate ?
6991,Leonard," If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?"
6992,Eliza,"Really, if the wedding's not until tomorrow ?"
6993,Missy," Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day."
6994,Eliza,Do you wish to be able to think so ?
6995,Sheldon," They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues."
6996,Eliza,But your friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night .
6997,Leonard," Look, you're here, we have plenty of room."
6998,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am here ?
6999,Sheldon, No we don't.
7000,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
7001,Howard," Come on, Shelly, she's family."
7002,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7003,Sheldon, So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.
7004,Eliza,Does that trouble you ?
7005,Missy, Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
7006,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7007,Sheldon, And don't ever call me Shelly.
7008,Eliza,Please go on.
7009,Leonard, So it's settled. You'll stay with us.
7010,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7011,Howard," I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?"
7012,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were in structure 3 level C ?
7013,Sheldon, What just happened?
7014,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
7015,Missy," So anyway, we're eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace."
7016,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
7017,Leonard," Hee-hee, just classic."
7018,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace .
7019,Sheldon, I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
7020,Eliza,Do you say you needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits for some special reason ?
7021,Missy, He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
7022,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7023,Sheldon, Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
7024,Eliza,Is it important that your room ?
7025,Missy," Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone."
7026,Eliza,Your eyebrows are gone ?
7027,Howard," Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?"
7028,Eliza,What about your own eyebrows? ?
7029,Missy, Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
7030,Eliza,Your Mom ?
7031,Sheldon, Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
7032,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
7033,Penny," Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs."
7034,Eliza,"Oh, I left my underwear in the dryer downstairs ?"
7035,Leonard, Those are not mine.
7036,Eliza,Did you think they might not be not mine ?
7037,Penny," Really, they have your little name label in them."
7038,Eliza,I am not interested in names.
7039,Leonard," Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny."
7040,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your sister ?
7041,Missy, Hi.
7042,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your .
7043,Penny," Wow, you don't look that much alike."
7044,Eliza,What other connections do you see ?
7045,Howard, Can I get a hallelujah.
7046,Eliza,Do you want to be able to get a hallelujah ?
7047,Sheldon," Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
7048,Eliza,What do you suppose that resemblence means ?
7049,Howard, Hallelujah.
7050,Eliza,But your eyebrows are gone .
7051,Raj," Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness."
7052,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
7053,Penny," Hey, good for you, Raj."
7054,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7055,Raj," Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects."
7056,Eliza,You are sure.
7057,Raj," So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?"
7058,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7059,Missy," Well, there's Dr Patel at our church."
7060,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your Mom drew on ?
7061,Raj," Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man."
7062,Eliza,I see.
7063,Howard," Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog."
7064,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7065,Raj, A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
7066,Eliza,"Oh, I have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front ?"
7067,Howard, You still have to wear a helmet.
7068,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7069,Raj, Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
7070,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7071,Missy, The sex book?
7072,Eliza,Earlier you said your room .
7073,Raj," The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
7074,Eliza,Do you think its likely that I wonder wonder who wrote the book of love ?
7075,Penny," Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w...."
7076,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
7077,Leonard, I wasn't staring!
7078,Eliza,You say you wasn't staring! ?
7079,Penny," I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute."
7080,Eliza,Perhaps in your fantasies we didn't say each other.
7081,Leonard," Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect."
7082,Eliza,Do you wish that I like women who are tall ?
7083,Penny," Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?"
7084,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
7085,Sheldon, I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.
7086,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
7087,Leonard, I brought snacks.
7088,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
7089,Missy, Oh my! Gherkins and....
7090,Eliza,Earlier you said your sister .
7091,Leonard," Onion dip, it's onion dip."
7092,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7093,Missy, Oh.
7094,Eliza,Please go on.
7095,Leonard, We don't entertain much.
7096,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7097,Raj," Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
7098,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7099,Missy, I guess.
7100,Eliza,Do you say you guess for some special reason ?
7101,Raj, We Indians invented them. You're welcome.
7102,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be welcome .
7103,Howard," Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!"
7104,Eliza,Why do you say your people invented circumcision ?
7105,Penny," Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?"
7106,Eliza,Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ?
7107,Missy, God yes. Thanks.
7108,Eliza,I understand.
7109,Penny, You're welcome.
7110,Eliza,What makes you think I am welcome ?
7111,Missy, Bye guys.
7112,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your nails done ?
7113,Howard, Bye Missy.
7114,Eliza,But your people invented circumcision .
7115,Leonard," Bye Missy, see you."
7116,Eliza,"Oh, I ?"
7117,Penny, Goodbye Leonard!
7118,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7119,Leonard," Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny."
7120,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
7121,Howard," Okay, you two have to back off."
7122,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7123,Raj," Why should I back off, you back off dude."
7124,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
7125,Leonard," Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister."
7126,Eliza,Who else in your family ?
7127,Howard," So what, you've already got Penny."
7128,Eliza,What do you think ?
7129,Leonard, How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
7130,Eliza,What comes to mind when you ask that ?
7131,Howard, So I can have Penny?
7132,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
7133,Leonard," Hell, no!"
7134,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your roommate's sister .
7135,Sheldon," Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?"
7136,Eliza,Are you thinking of a very special person ?
7137,Leonard," Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
7138,Eliza,Perhaps you don't want to talk to I in private? .
7139,Sheldon," I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
7140,Eliza,Were you really ?
7141,Leonard, Thank you.
7142,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7143,Sheldon, That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
7144,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7145,Howard," I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!"
7146,Eliza,How long have you been a fancy Indian man ?
7147,Raj," Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin."
7148,Eliza,Don't you really have a foreskin ?
7149,Leonard," Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
7150,Eliza,Would you prefer if I weren't aware that my sister is an incredibly attractive woman? ?
7151,Sheldon," Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence."
7152,Eliza,You seem to be quite positive.
7153,Leonard," That's fascinating, but I..."
7154,Eliza,You say That's fascinating ?
7155,Sheldon," I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
7156,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
7157,Leonard," Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister."
7158,Eliza,Your sister ?
7159,Sheldon," Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought."
7160,Eliza,What do you know about you'd begun with that thought ?
7161,Leonard," That's great, but I...."
7162,Eliza,Do you say That's great for some special reason ?
7163,Sheldon, What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
7164,Eliza,Have you asked such questions before ?
7165,Leonard, Whatever. You have to do something about it.
7166,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7167,Sheldon, Why?
7168,Eliza,Earlier you said your point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz .
7169,Leonard, Because she's your sister.
7170,Eliza,Does that reason seem to explain anything else ?
7171,Sheldon," I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways."
7172,Eliza,Why don't you understand ?
7173,Leonard," Okay, uh.... oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate."
7174,Eliza,Are you worried about someone else's responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate ?
7175,Sheldon, I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.
7176,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
7177,Leonard, Uh-huh.
7178,Eliza,Please go on.
7179,Sheldon," So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself."
7180,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7181,Leonard," Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring."
7182,Eliza,"Oh, I owe it to myself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of my sister's future offspring ?"
7183,Sheldon," You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me."
7184,Eliza,"Really, if someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes ?"
7185,Raj," I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!"
7186,Eliza,Do you believe it is normal to be Shiva the destroyer ?
7187,Howard," I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp."
7188,Eliza,Why do you tell me you were judo champion at math camp now ?
7189,Sheldon," Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister."
7190,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your sister ?
7191,Howard, Who are you to decide that?
7192,Eliza,Perhaps I am to decide that? in your fantasies.
7193,Leonard," He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
7194,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7195,Sheldon," You're out too, by the way."
7196,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am out too ?
7197,Leonard, Say what?
7198,Eliza,But your sister .
7199,Sheldon," It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie."
7200,Eliza,Do you think its likely that your future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie ?
7201,Howard, What are you so happy about?
7202,Eliza,Have you asked anyone else ?
7203,Raj," I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling."
7204,Eliza,How have I helped you to be happy ?
7205,Sheldon," Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister."
7206,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
7207,Howard, Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
7208,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7209,Leonard," We all make mistakes, let's move on."
7210,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your sister ?
7211,Raj," Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here."
7212,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were missing a big opportunity here ?
7213,Sheldon, How so?
7214,Eliza,Why do you ask ?
7215,Raj, Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
7216,Eliza,"Who, may I ask ?"
7217,Sheldon," In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
7218,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7219,Raj, I think you're focussing entirely too much on the drugs.
7220,Eliza,Perhaps you would like to be focussing entirely too much on the drugs .
7221,Howard," Is it ‘cause I'm Jewish, ‘cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
7222,Eliza,Who else in your family ?
7223,Sheldon," This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother."
7224,Eliza,What makes you think I am a tiny ?
7225,Leonard," Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable."
7226,Eliza,Does it please you to believe I am really being unreasonable ?
7227,Sheldon, Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
7228,Eliza,Your sister ?
7229,Missy, Oh really?
7230,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your Rabbi with a porkchop to be with my sister .
7231,Sheldon, Oops.
7232,Eliza,Earlier you said your sister .
7233,Missy," Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?"
7234,Eliza,Does that question interest you ?
7235,Sheldon, Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
7236,Eliza,Someone special perhaps ?
7237,Leonard," We all make mistakes, let's move on."
7238,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7239,Missy, Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
7240,Eliza,Do you enjoy being not even going to ask why I are pimping you out for cheese ?
7241,Sheldon," Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
7242,Eliza,"Oh, I carry DNA of great potential ?"
7243,Missy, What on earth are you talking about?
7244,Eliza,What is it you really wanted to know ?
7245,Sheldon," Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock."
7246,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7247,Missy," And what do you mean, mediocre stock?"
7248,Eliza,Are such questions much on your mind ?
7249,Sheldon," That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."
7250,Eliza,Do you wish that I will ?
7251,Missy, Sheldon 2.0?
7252,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7253,Sheldon," Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
7254,Eliza,What do you know about I are not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced ?
7255,Missy, You have got to be kidding me!
7256,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7257,Sheldon, Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
7258,Eliza,Please go on.
7259,Missy," Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people."
7260,Eliza,What else comes to mind when you think of your Mom ?
7261,Sheldon," I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended."
7262,Eliza,"What is the connection, do you suppose ?"
7263,Missy," I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?"
7264,Eliza,"Really, if I want to start acting like a brother who cares about you ?"
7265,Sheldon, I have an alternate proposal.
7266,Eliza,You say you have an alternate proposal ?
7267,Missy, Go on.
7268,Eliza,But your twin brother is .
7269,Sheldon," You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins."
7270,Eliza,"You have a particular person in mind, don't you ?"
7271,Sheldon, Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
7272,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7273,Howard," Look, we have to settle this."
7274,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7275,Leonard, I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.
7276,Eliza,Could here really be some connection ?
7277,Raj," She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair."
7278,Eliza,Can you elaborate on that ?
7279,Howard," Oh, you poor, deluded bastard."
7280,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7281,Raj, Don't start with me dude.
7282,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7283,Howard, You want to go again? Let's go.
7284,Eliza,"Oh, I want to go again? Let's go ?"
7285,Leonard, Sit down.
7286,Eliza,Please go on.
7287,Howard, Okay.
7288,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7289,Leonard," If we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honourable way."
7290,Eliza,Do you think its likely that we're going to fight over Missy ?
7291,Leonard, And he's down!
7292,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7293,Howard," Come on, come on, get up."
7294,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7295,Leonard," Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
7296,Eliza,Please go on.
7297,Sheldon, I weep for humanity.
7298,Eliza,Do you say you weep for humanity for some special reason ?
7299,Leonard, Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news.
7300,Eliza,That's quite interesting.
7301,Penny," Ah, hey Leonard."
7302,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7303,Leonard," Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
7304,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7305,Penny," Uh, pretty much, why?"
7306,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7307,Leonard," Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?"
7308,Eliza,You say Nothing ?
7309,Penny, Of course.
7310,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7311,Missy," Hi, Leonard, what's up?"
7312,Eliza,Please go on.
7313,Leonard," Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?"
7314,Eliza,How ?
7315,Missy, That's so sweet. But no thanks.
7316,Eliza,Why not ?
7317,Leonard," Oh. You have other plans, or...?"
7318,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7319,Missy, No.
7320,Eliza,Why 'no' ?
7321,Leonard, Oh. Alright uh... enjoy the rest of your evening.
7322,Eliza,"Really, my evening ?"
7323,Missy, Thanks. See you.
7324,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7325,Leonard," Um, here's something we didn't anticipate."
7326,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7327,Penny," What do you want, Howard?"
7328,Eliza,What answer would please you most ?
7329,Howard," I'm fine, thanks for asking. I've come to call on Missy."
7330,Eliza,Is it because you are fine that you came to me ?
7331,Penny, Missy?
7332,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7333,Missy, Hi Howard.
7334,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7335,Howard, The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
7336,Eliza,"Oh, I like magic? ?"
7337,Missy, Not really. No.
7338,Eliza,Are you saying no just to be negative?
7339,Howard," Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane.  Da-dah!"
7340,Eliza,Do you sometimes wish you were in for a treat ?
7341,Missy, No.
7342,Eliza,You are being a bit negative.
7343,Howard, Okay.
7344,Eliza,Please go on.
7345,Penny, Missy?
7346,Eliza,What does that suggest to you ?
7347,Raj, Thank you. I apprec....  apprec.... appreeee.... oh-oh.
7348,Eliza,You're not really talking about me -- are you ?
7349,Penny," Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?"
7350,Eliza,Why are you concerned over my medication wearing off? ?
7351,Missy," Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up."
7352,Eliza,Perhaps I already know you were hoping you'd show up .
7353,Missy, We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
7354,Eliza,Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
7355,Missy, Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?
7356,Eliza,Do you wish to believe I want you ?
7357,Sheldon," Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory."
7358,Eliza,Is it important that your research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory ?
7359,Missy," Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey."
7360,Eliza,What are your feelings now ?
7361,Sheldon," Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles."
7362,Eliza,Your testicles ?
7363,Missy," Come on, Shelly.  I want you to know I'm very proud of you."
7364,Eliza,What would getting I to know you are very proud of I mean to you ?
7365,Sheldon, Really?
7366,Eliza,Does that have anything to do with the fact that your research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory ?
7367,Missy," Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist."
7368,Eliza,Tell me more about your family.
7369,Sheldon, You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?
7370,Eliza,We were discussing you -- not me.
7371,Missy, Well yeah.
7372,Eliza,Earlier you said your brother the rocket scientist .
7373,Sheldon, I'm a theoretical physicist.
7374,Eliza,How long have you been a theoretical physicist ?
7375,Missy, What's the difference?
7376,Eliza,Lets discuss further why your testicles .
7377,Sheldon, What's the difference?
7378,Eliza,I'm not sure I understand you fully.
7379,Missy, Goodbye Shelly.
7380,Eliza,Please go on.
7381,Sheldon," My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating."
7382,Eliza,Why do you say your God! Why don't I just tell them you are a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist ?
